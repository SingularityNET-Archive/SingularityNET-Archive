## Quarterly report for Q1 2024
> Affects only this workgroup
> https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/88

> there have been a couple of minor changes suggested. Also we want to try out presenting it in a format that is more closely linked to our budget request  - e.g. via notes on the budget spreadsheetfor Q1

## Rationale (Optional)
> spreadsheet approach might connect reporting more closely to budget request, to support tracking and accountability, which is something that has been discussed in general terms in Treasury Guild meetings

## Opposing arguments (Optional)
> The existing text-based format is probably more readable, and allows a WG to make narrative points about how their work has gone. Worth trying both formats.
