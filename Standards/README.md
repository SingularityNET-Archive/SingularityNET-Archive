## SinguarityNet Archive Doc (SNet-Doc)

A SinguarityNet Archive Doc (SNet-Doc) is a formalised design document for the SinguarityNet Archive community. 

A SNet-Doc provides information or describes a change to the SinguarityNet Archive. 

In this SNet-Doc, we explain what a SNet-Doc is; how the SNet-Doc process functions; the role of the SNet-Doc Editors; and how users should go about proposing, discussing and structuring a SNet-Doc.

This process is broadly based on Blockchain Improvement Proposals (see https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/ekphrasis/sources/blockchain-improvement-proposals)
