Providing services according to the needs and the timelines of other groups, while tapping into their budgets, is best delivered by a separate unit, perhaps a financially self-sufficient Workgroup. Without a clear separation, I do not see bringing more external business or recruiting specific skill sets, as those may not align with Ambassadors mandate and plan.",
