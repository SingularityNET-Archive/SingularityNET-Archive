# Consent Decision-making for Ambassador Q1 budgets



We’re making our first decision as a group of Core Contributors! It’s about approving the WorkGroup budgets for Q1 2024 (Jan, Feb, March).

### Here are the key things you need to know:



Yup, this is about Q1, which is now over. We’ve left it quite late! But we still need to formally decide.

The decision-makers are everyone who currently has the Core Contributor role (those who have contributed at least 12 hrs to the Ambassador Program in the last 6 months). As a core contributor, you don’t **have** to take part - but it would be great if you did.

Whatever we decide in this process **only** relates to Q1 budgets - it won’t set any kind of precedent for the future.

There is a proposal on the table, that came out of Treasury Guild meetings. You can read it below.

All core contributors will be sent a Google form, where you can say if you consent to the proposal,  object to it, or abstain. The closing date to send the form back is Sun 31st March at 23:59 UTC. Note that the form results will only be shared among the Core Contributors; we don’t plan to publicise who said what!

Consenting does not mean you think the proposal is perfect - it just means you think it would be safe to try it. In other words, **acceptance rather than agreement** . But if you think there are serious reasons why we should not accept it, you can object.

If anyone objects, we will hold a meeting where we can all discuss it, and see if we can make changes so that the objectors feel it is safe to give their consent. If they still can’t, we will share the form again, together with details of what was said in the meeting, and use an “80% acceptance” rule - if 80% or more of those who fill in the form consent, then the proposal will go ahead.

If there isn’t at least 80% consent, then we’ll need to look for an alternative proposal. Any Core Contributor can put one forward.

Just for info - this process is called **consent decision-making** . You can read more about the thinking behind it here , here and here . What we are doing is slightly different from a “classic” consent process, because we need to enable ways for people to participate asynchronously.

### The proposal you’re being asked about is:

Given that Q1 2024 is now almost at an end, and the AGIX price is high, for Q1 we should simply sign off the existing WorkGroup budget requests as a whole (a total of 107,684 AGIX - individual totals detailed here ) rather than scrutinising individual workgroup budgets.
