# Feedback notes for Meeting Summaries tool and templates

NB most of these issues were addressed in meeting between André, Onyeka and Vanessa on 4th December 2023

## Interface is not very mobile-friendly (image is how it looks on IOS)





André will look at making the interface a bit more mobile-friendly, or at least see what is possible.

## Several questions about versioning, commenting on versions, and approving

I’ve left more than 1 current version unapproved in Onboarding, so we can go through it.



One question was how a group makes changes and approves a meeting summary - and it’s true that the process:

is a little different from doing it in a Googledoc, since it’s sequential. In a doc, you can have multiple people’s changes and suggestions at once, but in the tool, it’s one set of changes at a time, and they are each linked to a different person’s account, so you can’t see them all at once. WHAT IF a group could somehow log in with a group account?

demands that whole group, not just the documenter, is reasonably familiar with the tool. Is this overambitious? (after discussion we think no, it’s OK)

More readable version for when the whole group is editing? (André to look at this)



## Adding multiple things to a field isn’t intuitive?

At first, people are thinking you can only add one thing to e.g. tag fields. We probably need a tooltip to explain “Add something, hit Enter, add another, hit Enter” etc - **Fixed ( Review tooltip)**



## Issues with persistence of existing data when something is added: FIXED

Onyeka found that when you add a second (e.g.) discussion point to the “Discussion points” field, it refreshes automatically, and the data that has been added in other fields disapppears, and has to be re-added. - **Fixed**



## Issues with adding links in “tags” fields (emotions, refernce links, etc) FIXED

Onyeka found that if you add a link to the tags field, it doesn’t save? Basically same issue as above - **Fixed**



## Idea of having existing links from previous meetings already populated

**FIXED** We have discussed this - idea that several of a group’s links might be the same from meeting to meeting, so the tool should pre-poulate with them.FIXED - it’s in “working docs” now - table at bottom of page.

Remove “references” box, since this is covered **- Fixed**

HOW does it display in the GitBook?? **- Fixed**

Currently can add a doc - need to be able to remove as well **- Fixed**

Adding docs at top and appears at bottom is a little confusing - add and remove shd be in 1 place - **Fixed**

## May need to look at issue of adding document titles

FIXED - part of the above. We’ve discussed the idea of needing the doc title, not just the link, so an AI can find docs that are relevant to a particulafr keyword search. How do we signal to people that this is what they need to do? Tooltip?



## On Decisions “who does it affect” -

Do we need to add “may affect other individuals”? or is that overcomplicating things? Example : Onboarding WG’s survey deadline won’t really affect other WGs, but it will affect individuals outside the Onboarding WG...

Change to “ other **people** ” - **Fixed**





## Issues from meeting on 4th December 2023:

SAVE button at bottom - text should be bigger so it’s more visible - **Fixed**

Date format in “select meeting date” should change to (date) (month in words) (year) - **Fixed**

In Onboarding template, “In this meeting we discussed” appears first in the template, but doesn’t appear first when summary is posted? - **Fixed**

Once a meeting summary for a given date is approved and posted to GitBook, other versions for that date should disappear and no longer show in the tool to avoid confusion **- Fixed**

“Who a decision affects” - people should have to select an option, no default, cos otherwise it’s easy to miss - **Fixed**

Decision: “Rationale” and “Opposing Arguments” need (optional) in brackets after. Also need tooltips to make it clear what they are for. - **Fixed (Need to review tooltips)**

More readable version needed for when the whole group is editing?

Should this also include outputting an agenda as a doc? Include action items to check off, and anything you’re carrying over; also enable adding agenda items to it?







## Notes from testing, mid-Dec 2023



The “People present” field doesn’t look great on a phone - if there’s more than about 6 people to add, it becomes hard to see the end of the list of possible people to add (Onyeka)
