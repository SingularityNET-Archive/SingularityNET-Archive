#### Context - â€œmembership
> * Colleen Pridemore: I think membership is a good idea -- sorry I missed you guys today.Â  See you Wednesday!
>   - Vanessa Cardui: hey Colly - any thoughts on what membership criteria should be?

Many WGs do it based on meeting attendance - but I think we'll be doing quite a lot of work in separate little teams or async, and might not have that many full meetings. 
So I dunno what other criterion we could use...

#### Context - 1) Who is up for documenting this meeting? (2 mins)
We have budget... ðŸ™‚
> * Ayo OLU-AYOOLA7D: Ayo here.
I am up for documenting.
I shall attend both meetings...
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Fab, thanks Ayo! LadyTempestt's already volunteered for Monday, so if you could do the Tuesday that would be ace.
LadyTempestt has created a template to use, actually - if you want to use it, can share it here?
>   - Vanessa Cardui: @ayodeleadaramola6@gmail.com - you can ofc document straight into the Meeting Summary Tool hereÂ https://archive-oracle.netlify.app/ - or if you prefer, here is LadyTempestt's template https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jj4gaA3tVEC9xhMbZ9Inn5PX2bVBOeIBc8XVPt3njXM/edit
>   - Ayo OLU-AYOOLA7D: Okay that's fine.
I will document for today's meeting.

My email address is oluayoola7d@gmail.com just in case

> * Love Owokere: I could try documentation but I need some kind of format used here to document. I'm coming on Monday btw
>   - Vanessa Cardui: ah great - thanks!
Format is basically just capturing who's here; a meeting narrative (just a brief "what was said"); and any decisions and action items coming out of the meeting. Here's how a related meeting was documented, to give you an idea https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2024/may-2024/week-19#ai-ethics-wg - doesn't need to be a huge level of detail :-)
