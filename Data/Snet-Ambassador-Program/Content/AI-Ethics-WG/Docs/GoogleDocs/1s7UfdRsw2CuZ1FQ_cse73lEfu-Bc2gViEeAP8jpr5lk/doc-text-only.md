# Draft agenda for inaugural AI Ethics WG meetings

**(Mon 10th and Weds 12th June 2024)Note: Monday‚Äôs meeting is documented hereand will be added via the Summary Tool shortly**



## 1) Who is up for documenting this meeting? (2 mins)

We have budget... üôÇ

## 2) Strategy-drafting (20 mins)

Based on this WG‚Äôs Q2 budget proposal , one of the key things we planned to do this Quarter was to start drafting 3 strategies (Ethics, Research, Knowledge Management).

We‚Äôre a little late getting started - but we have a spreadsheet where people can express interest Anyone interested who hasn‚Äôt signed up, please do

We‚Äôd like this WG to be a place where people can learn, and where people with less experience pair up with and ‚Äúshadow‚Äù people with more, as much as poss. Are people broadly in agreement with this approach?  (Monday‚Äôs meeting said yes)

How shall we proceed? Everyone interested takes part? Or do we need to select? Teams should probably be small-ish, for effective writing. Maximum 3? 4? ( Monday‚Äôs meeting suggested we separate Writers and Reviewers; max 3 writers and 2 reviewers - and people should only sign up for 1 thing. Is this meeting in agreement? Any refinements? )

Whoever does  the work will need to attend a meeting with Haley, Esther, LeeLou,  to thrash out some basics before going off to work on the strategy drafts (and then a 2nd meeting to share the work when done). We have budgeted for 4 people x 2 meetings - do we need more than 4? We could reallocate a bit of budget...

And - How to pick a date? Another When2Meet?

After that, we suggest the teams try to work async on the strategy drafts, and/or with small team meetings.

## 3) A co-chair? (5 mins)

Our Q2 budget suggested we would have a co-chair from this group to work with the Foundation Ethics group.

Do we want to?

If yes, is it something we want to sort out now? Or next Quarter?

## 4) WG ‚Äúmembership‚Äù? (10 mins)

Do we feel we need a formal ‚Äúmembership‚Äù and a Discord role tag for this WG?

If yes, what should criteria be?

Engagement time?Attending meetings =/= engagement necessarily

## 5 ) Budget for Q3 (10 mins)

Can we start collating a list of stuff this WG would like to do in Q3, and what it might cost? If yes, how shall we collate and comment on budget ideas? A doc? And how will we agree them - another meeting, or something else?Draft has been started in Sheet 3 of

For reference

An idea from Leeloo and Vani - we‚Äôd like to fund people‚Äôs time to have ‚Äúethics‚Äù conversations and discussions. What do you think?

Another idea - producing resources to demystify basic AI ethics terminology?

Another idea - the overall Global Ethics Initiative will conduct research to find out what ordinary people‚Äôs views are about AI ethics. Should we fund WG members to do outreach (either online, or IRL in people‚Äôs actual communities, or both) and conduct interviews? If yes, should we fund appropriate training?

## 6) Private Forum space for ethics discussions? (10 mins)

Discussion/conversation about actual ‚Äúethics‚Äù topics tends to get lost in a WG channel.

Should we use the existing Ambassador Forum?

Or do we want a separate (private?) forum specifically for this WG?

Specifically for discussion

Admins would help

Interested in being admins: LeeLoo, Duke, Gorga, Clement

## 7) Shall we meet again this quarter? (5 mins)

If yes, when? and to do what?

**24th** and 26th?
