# Ethics Workgroup:

Q2 2024 Budget proposal

### Context

This initiative was discussed in the Global AI Governance and Ethics open office on April 23, 2024 in which several members from the SingularityNET Community and the Ambassador program joined the bi-weekly space hosted by Haley & Esther.

There was strong consent on the need for focus on AI Ethics, and the support to initiate a new Workgroup.



For further information, please see .

### Why the WG is needed, and how it will help the Ambassador program

The topic of AI ethics is highly relevant for each initiative working in the AI space. Our efforts and findings therefore aim to bring benefit to ideally each Guild and Workgroup in the Ambassador program, as well as to groups and communities outside the SingularityNET ecosystem.



The initiative may attract more participants to the ecosystem and may in time create a revenue stream for the decentralized communities, which financially also could benefit the Ambassadors. The project will also build more trust and recognition within the Foundation of the Ambassadors’ skills and efforts.

### What kind of activities the WG will do (Optionally can set out specific activities that will be done in the WG’s first quarter)



Facilitation of fortnightly meetings, and of any other processes that emerge;

Processing some of the conversations collected during BGI

Giving us a space to slow down and listen, and explore what we want to create; and then for ideating an amazing “Listening Machine” for building human ground truth ethics =)

Starting and managing conversations on social media about AI ethics, including ensuring informed consent and ethical research practices

Contributing to research strategy with Foundation team

Data processing of social media conversations



### Who will facilitate or run the group (at least for its first quarter)

One facilitator from the Foundation, and a WG co-chair/primary contact from the Ambassador program.

### An idea of how many people are currently interested in attending, and whether they are already involved in the program, or new

25 people - roughly half and half new, and already involved

### What skills someone could use, or learn, by attending this WG

****

Critical thinking and analysis: Participants will need to evaluate complex issues related to AI, technology, and ethics, and think deeply about the potential impacts and consequences of different policies and practices.

Communication and collaboration: Workgroups are all about sharing ideas, listening to others, and working together towards a common goal, so participants will have the opportunity to practice effective communication and teamwork.

Research and writing: Depending on the Workgroup's objectives, participants may need to conduct research, analyze data, and write reports or recommendations based on their findings.

Facilitation

Documentation

Ethical decision-making: Perhaps most importantly, participants will gain experience in applying ethical principles and frameworks to real-world situations involving AI, and develop a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by these technologies.

### How often the proposed WG would meet (if it meets at all. It could be async.)

Open meetings every 2 weeks

### How the WG’s activities could be audited or tracked

Using the Ambassador task & treasury system

Meeting notes & documentation

Maintaining a public communication hub (Discord/TG/MM/etc)



### Any risks, and how they will be mitigated

Lack of clarity around strategy, as this is early in the project’s timeline

Mitigation: Cost some strategy meetings



Coordination challenges: a large number of people showed interest (great!).

Mitigation: Establish clear roles. We can consider limiting the number of highly active roles. There could be paid roles and volunteer roles at first. Establish clear task assignment in line with the budget from the start.



Resource constraints: Funds could be scattered across too many people doing too many small tasks.

Mitigation: As above; consider limiting group size at first; establish clarity about who is responsible for which tasks and set clear limitations around how many tasks are funded per workstream.

### A budget for what the group’s core activities would cost for its first quarter



This will comprise both running costs (facilitation, documenting, managing) and core activities; and, for this initial quarter, there is a focus on communication and community outreach.



NB: The below is tentative and subject to some change depending on the strategy developed by the workgroup.
