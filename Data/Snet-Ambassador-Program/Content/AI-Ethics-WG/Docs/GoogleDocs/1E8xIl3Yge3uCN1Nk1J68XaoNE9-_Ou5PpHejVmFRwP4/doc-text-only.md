# Interview participant information sheet

Topic: AI Ethics and Governance

Principal investigators:   Esther Galfalvi, Haley Lowy, LeeLoo Rose



This interview is part of an initiative to gather thoughts from the general public about AI ethics, safety, and governance. We would like to find out what people think about AI, how they feel about the way that AI governance and development is taking place, and how they feel they should be empowered to take part in AI governance. In the months after the interviews, we will provide discussion spaces to talk about AI ethics so that you can have a role in shaping the future of AI.



**Interviews are expected to last about 5-10 minutes, and will include 3-4 questions about AI ethics and governance. The questions are not definitive; you can expand to other topics if they arise.**



You are not obligated to answer all or any of the questions.You can stop the interview at any time without having to give a reason.



To help with the research, the interviewer may digitally record the interview (audio only). Let the interviewer know if you are not comfortable with this.



**No information will be published that could identify you, your answers, or your institution/organisation, and the information we collect will be held securely in accordance with GDPR (2016) on password protected computers and secure cloud accounts. It is also in compliance with freedom of information legislation.**



If you would like to withdraw your information, please email esther.galfalvi@singularitynet.io within 14 days and your data will be deleted. After this time we cannot guarantee that your data can be removed, as it may go through AI processing. However, **all data will be anonymised before processing, so you cannot be identified.**



You may take this information sheet with you in case you decide to withdraw.



Do you have any questions about the research? If so, ask the interviewer, or if you would like to know more after the interview, contact us on the above email.
