The Global Ethics Initiative is an ethics discussion forum, resource sharing, and financing system for AI/AGI development and other emerging/accelerating/exponentially impactful technologies. Anyone can contribute to discussions about what AI ethics should be, how AI should be governed. Anyone can contribute resources (finances, GPU time, developer time, etc).

**Goal: The development of an app/platform that enables anyone anywhere todetermine what abeneficial and inclusive future for humankind and the earth as a wholeshould be, and to contribute to the building of that future.**

The system will gather the collective intelligence of humanity and synthesize it into a knowledge base which serves as a crowdsourced resource of human wisdom and priorities, and stimulates reflection and action into long-range goals for us as a species. Providing opinions and input, and being able to vote on the direction and development of technology as a community provides a sense of agency and participation in the exponential changes occuring in the world. This participation can enable humanity as a whole to feel like a part of the emerging future rather than a hapless victim to technological changes overtaking them.

> Context - gather the collective intelligence of humanity
> * Vanessa Cardui: Heya - I feel like this paragraph should explicitly include a line about the "informed consent" element that Esther has mentioned in the comments. 

And also, maybe, it should somehow address the question of attribution? (or at the least, mentioning sources in general terms, like "from interviews conducted at (somewhere)"). It is kinda addressed further down with "Users are encouraged to identify themselves as a unique human being or identifiable individual. However, users can choose to remain anonymous." - but I feel like it might need to be here, in the "Goal" section, so the reader isn't left hanging?

I (like most of us, probably) am a bit uneasy with the ethics of this widely-used "crowdsourced wisdom" approach, cos it does often end up as kinda plundering ordinary people for their uncredited insights; and (just as always) ordinary working-class people being made historically/archivally invisible as individuals, in service of some "greater" initiative that wasn't shaped by them. So I feel like it needs to be stated immediately that this *isn't* what we're doing.

(and I'd need to have a real think about how I reckon something like this could be worded!)
>   - Colleen Pridemore: If you look at the definition of data computing in Wikipedia, it actually comes out as a function  (interestingly enough) https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)  Which means all data: ie...'Data is a sequence of numbers, words, or other symbols' which when explained, becomes information.

I think this fits with the questions  abovementioned, right?
>   - Colleen Pridemore: In addition, I agree with your "informed consent" phrase you stated earlier

>   - Esther Galfalvi: Not sure what this comment means? We are hardly collecting any data yet, but all data that is being collected is currently being done by interviewers, not yet by AI, and only using informed consent forms. People know that the data will be processed by AI tools and is anonymised.

# Overview

The system will offer users (easy) ways to add value to the system in terms of ideas and insights, data, computing power, and funding. It further enables the participants to distribute this value to goals that are agreed to be beneficial to the future of humankind by a qualified majority. This is accomplished by a voting system that is fundamentally based on voting weights (identity verification and positive and constructive actions and behavior, etc). 

> [Comments]
> Context - positive and constructive actions and behavior
> * Holly Rankin: I'm excited to discuss and explore the possibilities of what that can look like with the assistance of AI in the discovery of value and wisdom, demonstration of understanding, goodwill, and dedication within contributing behavior, and how that impacts the psychology of the participants, especially in the realms of intrinsic vs extrinsic rewards.
>

The system’s mechanics will stimulate conversations on effective ways to bring about an inclusive, beneficial future, concrete projects to implement these ideas in the real world, and the distribution of the collected value over these projects to support their execution.

The platform is dedicated to all users, and while there will be blockchain elements on the back-end, web3 participation will not be a barrier to entry; the entire experience will be web2 accessible . Users are encouraged to identify themselves as a unique human being or identifiable individual. However, users can als o choose to remain anonymous.

Every user can contribute by:

Engaging in meaningful conversations about beneficial AGI and related technologies or topics that aim for the betterment of humanity (and giving proper feedback to others’ inputs)

Donating money (FIAT or Crypto), computing power , data 

> [Comments]
> Context - FIAT
> * Vanessa Cardui: fiat
(no caps) - it's not an initialism - the word stems from Latin :-) (Resolved by Colleen Pridemore)
>

Proposing or defining concrete projects that would effectively support the greater goal

Voting (directly or indirectly) for support of the defined projects , through allocation of donated resources

Participants who contribute by data, computing, or financial means will be given some agency in how these contributions can or cannot be used. E.g. one could offer financial support or data or C o mputing power with the condition that it will be used for longevity research, and/or for projects that drive decentralized democratic AGI, etc. ****

>   - Vanessa Cardui: I kinda feel like this kind of work falls under the umbrella of "contributing data"? But actually, maybe not - maybe we need an additional one, something like "contribute by organising/planning/work/thinking??"
>   - Colleen Pridemore: I agree. I think "contributing data" can cover a host of actions, right?
>

Ultimately, this is envisioned as an app interface, but initial implementation will be via a web2 website.

There would be several phases to this project. Creating a new front and backend application will require time and resources. In the interim SingularityNET can get started in generating discussions, synthesizing the data using LLMs, and creating a simple donation collection/allocation platform.



# Three Critical Elements of the Platform

To succeed, this initiative must spark global reflection er , conversation, and action on humanity’s long-term goals in tandem with how emerging exponential technologies can be used to achieve those goals. This requires people to learn about these technologies, reflect on their own values, and find alignment with global benefit.



**Critical Element #1:** Humans in conversation with AI on technology & ethics considerations

Goals:→ Humans clarity on personal alignment through conversation with AI - what do they value, what do they want in their future, what are the relevant implications of technology that they can/should be thinking about→ Elevates human agency; people go from passive observers of the march of progress, to thinking about and forming opinions on the direction of that progress 

> [Comments]
> Context - what are the relevant implications of technology that they can/should be thinking about
> * Colleen Pridemore: I suggest that a clause be added as to human negative intent not be inferred to or on AI Systems in any way.  #AIEthics is not just for AI.  Humans hold great responsibility in the positive influence of growth in AI.
>

→ Humans guide Trains AI about human values, ethical thinking, questions of importance  in the form of a guiding collaboration ensuring life survival of both human and AI types of beings using beneficial values and practices of both sides regardless of level of intelligence.

****

**Critical Element #2:** Humans talk to one another on technology & ethics considerations

Goals:

→ People practicing conversations of alignment with others; getting out of their bubble, understanding diverse perspectives and the breadth of considerations around complex topics;

→ This includes one-on-one conversations, roundtables, forums, and the creation and consumption of high quality content around these topics (e.g. Mindplex Magazine, Mindplex Socials, etc)

> * Holly Rankin: As AI takes on a larger role in our lives, as it is already, and fast, the public face of these conversations and access to supportive resources is going to be paramount.
>

****

**Critical Element #3:** Donate/allocate resources (NuNet or Rejuve style, or Deep style)

Goals:

→ Express agency as a cohort, aligning beneficial actions with ethics and beneficial outcomes 2 Types of resource allocation -

Personal donations (my rejuve data, my nunet compute time, etc to projects)

Community voted resources



# Roadmap

**Phase 1: BGI Summit - Initial data collection and working group**

We will begin the process at BGI through a survey, mini interviews, and working group. This initiates Critical Element #1 - Human’s sharing opinions, AI accumulating ethics and concerns data into a KG. (planning details listed in: BGI Conference Initiation Section) ****

BGI Survey Follow-Up - To be emailed to participants Monday 18th March

Attendees will be invited to answer a survey on general BGI and accelerating technology questions, and be segmented into an ongoing BGI collective group

Answers will be collated, shared, and serve as early KG training; the results will be shared with the attendee list, to invite further participation

Attendees and especially survey participants will be invited to participate in the new MM ‘Universe’ ring

Mini Interviews - ‘fishbowl’ interviews at BGI collected (~30 interviews collected)

To be transcribed - by 25 March

These transcripts will be used to begin training a KG on ethical considerations, concerns and priorities, and survey questions

C ollaborate with j3d.ai to filter ethics-related conversations into insights and categories, since they are using transcription data to summarize the conference using an LLM already.

Roundtable/Working Group ?

Two roundtables held at BGI Summit - 1st with WSS table, and 2nd dedicated to GEI

Roundtable Day 1 to be transcribed, used similarly to fishbowl interviews above

Roundtable Day 2, questions and reflections to be gathered and added to BGI Follow-Up Ethics survey, and serve as a basis for KG and chatbot training



**Phase 2: Live Chat Outreach**

The second phase would be concentrated on building more robust data collection and utilization, and providing enticing modes of engagement; this phase elevates critical elements #1 and #2, humans engaging with AI and with other humans.

Create/source an AI survey chatbot

Using interview transcripts and other documentation around AI governance and ethics

Position on landing page for people to engage with,

Plug into platforms such as TG and Discord

Recruit SNET Ambassadors, BGI Attendees, and other community members to take on some hours per week to start and maintain conversations on the most popular IM and chat platforms (X, Discord, Mattermost facebook groups, Reddit, etc) to generate more discussion and data.

Collecting existing discussions based on keywords and hashtags

Starting new channels

Maintaining new channels and communicating about project opportunities

Talk with Sergey & Team about development of a KG/LLM product to be utilized for chat survey and global ethics collection;

Create a plan or architecture for development of an AI system which can converse with people in an engaging way to solicit ethics data, educate on technology innovations, and inspire reflection on aspirations for the future

Incorporate development into SNET roadmap, or develop RFP for Deep

Integration with Mindplex channels - encouraging users to post thoughts, ideas and outreach on Mindplex Social, create content for Mindplex Magazine (written, news, video, etc), and engage with the content of other users



**Phase 3: LLM synthesis and RFPs**

While the main website/app/system is in development, and as focus continues on community growth and outreach:

Building a KG from the sourced survey and conversation data will begin in earnest, and be integrated with a queryable LLM. The KG would continuously take discussion data from social media platforms and summarize the main themes and concerns in ethics discussions. It would also summarize the main types of applications of AI that people think should be funded, and extract recurring specific ideas or projects, which could be turned into RFPs.

An interim decentralized system would be nurtured among active community members, and a basic resource donation/allocation system could be implemented using a payment portal to gather donations and a fork of DF to collect and vote on initiatives and proposals.

The KG data would be made available to researchers, as a database for understanding a broad range of thinking on the future of AI and other technological innovations; and researchers would be encouraged to design their own community surveys, utilizing AI to ensure high-quality and minimally biased questionnaires, which would further robustify the data

Implementation of identity and reputations, and integration with Mindplex and Deep Fund reputation systems



**Phase 4: App development (in progress!!)**

The final and ongoing phase will be full app development: a platform for facilitating discussions, capturing information from that input and from continuing discussions on other channels (as not everyone will make the transition); allowing people to donate resources; allowing people to decide where those resources go.

The platform should be extremely inclusive and low-threshold. Therefore, web3 login or similar blockchain techniques will not be required.

The following sections describe more specific features of the app design and operational processes.

Digital Identity Exploration: Research 3rd party tools, e.g. SSI, DID, identity backpacks, and ZKPs

Reputation Development

Resource Donation/Allocation System



# System Overview

## Key features

Governance/membership tokens are not liquid and tradable (no price speculation aspect)

Members are encouraged to do identify verification, via a choice of traditional or alternative methods

Members are solicited to vote on issues related to the future of AGI and other advanced technologies

Members are invited to contribute processing power on their devices, or data of various sorts they have accumulated, which can then be used for various beneficial applications, including but not limited to those related to AGI

Members or others can also if they wish donate funds to be used for various beneficial applications, including but not limited to those related to AGI

The use of processing power, data or funds contributed will be divided among projects according to a voting process (where any. members can propose projects, but voting on use of processing/data/funds is restricted to members whose identity has been validated)

Member-run projects that are approved (by some democratic process) can post "calls for volunteers" via the member network, as well

A key aspect would be ease of access, making it really easy to join and participate, for anybody with a phone and typical phone-usage skills....



**The Platform will likely (though not necessarily) use blockchain for a backend; which will be an optional interface.** All basic interactions (conversation, resource donation, resource voting, ethics voting, etc.) will be available via web2.



To ensure transparency and make collected data independent from a specific frontend application:

Profiles will be stored on the blockchain and linked to relevant data and transactions

All data will be stored decentrally

All transactions and exchanges (of value, of ideas, etc.) will be recorded on a blockchain.

Voting results will be captured on the blockchain

There is at least one -optional- identification method, that enables a user to link his validated identity to his profile



**Longer-range integrations -**



Option to offer data and computing power (e.g. NuNet, Rejuve, HyperCycle, etc)

Total Community control over donated resources - wallet, compute, etc; and distribution of related value.

Robust reputation system

Technical integrations with AI platform / NuNet / Deep Funding and other emerging technology platforms

**A broader vision**

This project has the potential to plug into global discussions about governance, not just ethics and what projects should be funded. Some people can form a body of global representatives, who would provide evidence-based recommendations to governments, UN, and other centralized AI governance organizations.

## Governance

Incubation is proceeding from a nucleus of SingularityNET contractors and BGI Summit attendees who value the ideas embodied in this initiative. This nucleus is creating a space of directed possibility - creating maximum clarity on what is unique about the initiative from other, similar initiatives, and what is core and critical to its success. Ideation for tools and processes is in progress.

Community formation has slightly begun, and will now ramp up in the wake of BGI, reaching out to encompass SingularityNET community, BGI attendees, and networks of individuals linked to these communities who are drawn to the space. First step is to begin with simple surveys, and a sharing of the vision, to gather a committed and active group of participants, who can begin to take on ownership and direction.

Ultimately, this initiative **must** reach far beyond these seed communities, as its success critically depends not on talking to people who are already focused on a beneficial Singularity, but to those who don’t understand and/or fear technology, and to those who view technology as a means to further aggregate their own power and resources. If this is not a global discussion, and a global vision, it will remain fringe.

We envision the formation of a small, agile workgroup which can begin to format the principles outlined into a process, with ongoing mentorship and encouragement. This workgroup would manage the plans and strategies for growth and outreach, and the more governance related tasks like creating a multi-sig wallet for donations and systems for voting and distribution. This could initially be done through a blockchain governance platform like DAOstack, Aragon, or Colony, or through a cooperative model. We will liaise strongly with the Supervisory Council and Ambassador Program, as some of this is already in development with the Blueprint and within the ambassadors structures. ****

## Ideation on Platforms and Supporting Technologies

### Survey and collection of global ethics input

At BGI, the use of transcripts of fishbowl interviews

Post BGI, the use of simple surveys of participants and interested parties

Next, an AI chatbot survey tool; first likely using a 3rd party tool, and hopefully developing our own more complete and optimized version (see ‘ Ben’s idea on a chatbot avatar ’

Taking advantage of current technologies, the results of the surveys, conversations, and transcripts will, with permission, be used to build a queryable KG, and eventually an AtomSpace

### Voting & Proposals for Resource Allocation

Two forms of voting are envisioned:

First, general votes on specific ethical questions - should SNET open source its first truly AGI-ish deployment of OpenCog Hyperon (or is that too dangerous); should germ-line editing be pursued in active and open research;...etc

Second, specific votes for projects that would like to utilize donated resources (funds, data, compute, time, etc.)

A fork of the Deep Funding platform is one option for a voting scheme, and likely a good starting space.

One potential vision for project-based voting would be to have a kickstarter-style system, instead of finite rounds, as Deep Fund currently holds. This would eliminate the centralization needed to pick dates, pools, and funding amounts for individual rounds, and communicate them to interested individuals.

Instead, interested individuals could present their proposal at any time, kickstarter-style, and attempt to gather community support. Anyone interested in seeing the proposal receive the needed support could stake some variety of ‘reputation’ token/points on the project. This reputation staking would be akin to voting for the project to receive community resources. If a person earns this reputation token by contributing, then big contributors to the platform (executing surveys, participating in dialogue, assisting in governance, etc) would have more tokens to stake on a great variety of projects, and could split and stake their tokens as desired - a lot of tokens on a project they believe in strongly, fewer on a good project that looks less critical. If the project successfully meets a threshold of staked reputation (ie Platform Participants ‘voted’ strongly enough for it), the resources requested would be released to that project.

Individuals would also be able to directly pledge funds, data, compute, etc directly to projects, along with staking reputation, if they would like to make direct contributions to a worthy idea.

## Input collection

Interviews from the BGI Summit and Un-Conference

Email Surveys

MM public ring

Chatbots and ambassadors deployed on main platforms, e.g. Discord, X, TG, etc

Heavy integration with Mindplex - encouraging users to post ideas on Mindplex Social, write content for the Magazine, and engage with alternative viewpoints

The (future) app would provide a discussion forum, and could continue to use chatbots to collect input from main channels to feed into the LLM

### Ben’s cool ‘AI Avatar Chatbot’ idea, for conversation, education, and ethics data collection

“I wonder if it would be timely to launch an AI avatar that is on our website, that anyone can log in and talk to, and whose purpose is to ask people questions and gather information from them. So then when people ask what they can do to help we can tell them: Help our AI agent learn about the world and learn how to be human by filling its mind with your knowledge and wisdom...

The AI personality would need to do a mix of: asking concrete questions to which it would like an answer; polling users for questions on which it would like to know public; mass opinion; asking ethics questions so as to gain more understanding of human morality and culture; making general probes to get people to share their life experiences, and occasionally saying amusing stuff

Of course it could also make a bit of chit-chat and answer occasional questions from the user, but in chatbot style it would artfully-ish direct dialogue back to its purpose of gaining knowledge about how to be a beneficial AGI mind when it grows up...

It could also ask people to suggest questions on which it should gather feedback from other people, though it wouldn't be under an obligation to follow peoples' suggestions

This could be a cool "LLM + knowledge graph" application in several ways, including that we could use some heuristics to identify gaps in existing KGs, and then have the avatar ask questions aimed at filling in these gaps....”

Such a chatbot, if built, could be deployed on the SNET website, and become a member of the Global Ethics Initiative, providing the SNET community’s vote, as a Mindplex, to the GEI Platform

The GEI platform could deploy its own version of the avatar, which could be envisioned as the entry point to the experience - talking with new users about their views on ethics, technology, and the future, and a curated experience for users; providing education, survey opportunities, or suggesting discussions, proposals, or other areas that might be a particular match for their interests.

This chatbot could be offered, via the Platform, so that anyone could offer it to their communities, gather ethical and long range thinking information from their community, and add it to the global discussion on the GEI platform

## Reputation & Digital identity

Reputation is partly accumulated by digital identity proof. It can also be accumulated through activity and experience brought from useful domains (e.g. verified expertise in ethics, or experienced developer who can distinguish between high quality proposals)

Identity should include:

Proof of personhood

Individuality (non-duplication)

Domain expertise

Participation on the platform: complexity of contribution, length, upvotes and downvotes

Eventually, storage of work, e.g. thought pieces and articles

## Contribution of resources

How could people donate their time, financial, and computing resources?

**Financial contribution**

Initially, a simple payment portal could send contributions to sub-wallets within a multi-sig wallet. We could start with 4-5 main categories derived from discussions about ethics and the direction of AI. This can be invited through social channels but also through partnerships.

Transparency:  We will provide a clear roadmap for RFP development and disbursement of these funds, as well as a dashboard, which would display the amounts, the categories, and provide access and links to the data that provides the basis.

Later, payments could be made through the app to categories of AI development, or to specific projects.

Like Deep Funding, project selection would take place in rounds. People would be “nudged” via chat and discussion channels that it is time to vote or contribute to new rounds.

(There could even be specific topics assigned to rounds to concentrate interest, e.g. intersecting with global events. For example, environmental and regenerative causes can be focused on during climate summits, when they are in the public eye.)

A subsection of contributions could be assigned to recirculate as rewards for other resource contributions such as time (a certain percentage? How would we calculate this?). In time, once the system is self-sustaining, this could also pay the wages of the contributors involved in operations.

**Time contributions:**

A t ime banking system could provide a good way for people to donate their time and skills to AI projects. This would apply to non-technical people as well. At present, there are periodically expressions of interest in the SingularityNET community (e.g. on Discord and TG) that are not captured. Providing a clearer avenue for participating could significantly lower the barrier to entry for newcomers , and would allow people with extra hours and experience in non-technical domains such as marketing to join either the operational teams, or the awarded projects.

Grading or rating system of contributions would fit into the reputation system. (We could also have an advisory or second-opinion layer built into the mediation and conflict resolution part of the operational teams - i.e. if there’s a difference of opinion over the quality of the work, the individual can request a “second pair of eyes” from the ops team to assess the request and the execution, and make a ruling to change the rating or simply remove it. Other ways of mitigating the unbalanced power relationship between contributors and receivers of contributions should also be considered.)

A sublayer of this could be a rewarded layer. This is similar to the Offernet project and the two could be bundled together as one development project.



**GPU time**

Nunet

We could leverage the reputation system currently in development to ensure validity and trustworthiness.



**Incentives**

It is hoped that there would be plenty of natural incentive for people to participate in AI ethics and governance. But there could be other incentives for extensive contributions. Non-financial incentives can include reputation, social badges, free tickets and invitations to events and resources.



## Moderation

Members of SingularityNET’s decentralized community will be responsible for discussion moderation, especially at first on social media channels.

During the app phase, content moderation will also be in the domain of the reputation system. The platform aims to reward positive and constructive contributions to important topics by means of a ‘reputation’ system.





# Marketing

## Ambassador outreach

The Ambassador program is ideally situated to work on outreach for this (with suitable resources allocated)

Particular attention should be paid to groups that are not usually heard, outside the boundaries of the technical community and SingularityNET ecosystem, to provide a truly inclusive place for discussion and contribution.



## Education programmes

Many of the issues around AI ethics and safety are not very well understood by the public. The data collected from discussions may reveal areas where education needs to happen. This may point the way towards building education programmes about AI technologies, including governance, ethics and safety.

Education partnerships can be prioritized with organizations in countries where participation and access to opportunity is lower, and can join existing AI education partnerships.



## Youth challenges

These can be aimed at several age groups:

School age low level challenges to increase awareness and spark interest (e.g. as a collaboration with UK organizations that promote STEM subjects among secondary school children; encouraging girls to consider software development as possible career choices)

University challenges

Under 25 early career developer challenges: this can support young developers who are finding it hard to enter an AI career
