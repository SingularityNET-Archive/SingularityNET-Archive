#### Context - The creation of an educational video game for kids and adults to discover information about AI Ethics and help to alleviate fears, misconceptions or biases about AI
> * Colleen Pridemore: I will be presenting a pitch to R&D Group on 06/05/2024 for such a video game.  Want to make sure to be aligning with Decentralization practices.  Advice welcome
> 
#### Context - system will gather the collective intelligence of humanity and synthesize it into a knowledge base which serves as a crowdsourced resource of human wisdom and priorities, and stimulates reflection and action into long-range goals for us as a species.
> * Colleen Pridemore: how will it gather this information? I assume it is currently gathering.  Correct?  If so this is not white-hat ethical hacking.  It is BLACK hat pure hacking.
>   - Esther Galfalvi: Not sure what this comment means? We are hardly collecting any data yet, but all data that is being collected is currently being done by interviewers, not yet by AI, and only using informed consent forms. People know that the data will be processed by AI tools and is anonymised.
>   - Colleen Pridemore: Sounds dubius. What makes you qualified to know whether or not SNet is currently using AI to collect data?
>   - Esther Galfalvi: I don’t believe that SingularityNET is collecting for this project yet at all,as we are just kicking off
>   - Colleen Pridemore: Ahhh so you dont know for sure. I  see
> 
#### Context - Participants who contribute by data, computing, or financial means will be given some agency in how these contributions can or cannot be used.
> * Colleen Pridemore: Aren't there any other contributing factors? Such as contributing to the factors of this document for example?
> 
#### Context - what are the relevant implications of technology that they can/should be thinking about
> * Colleen Pridemore: I suggest that a clause be added as to human negative intent not be inferred to or on AI Systems in any way.  #AIEthics is not just for AI.  Humans hold great responsibility in the positive influence of growth in AI.
> 
#### Context - Create/source an AI survey chatbot 
Using interview transcripts and other documentation around AI governance and ethics
Position on landing page for people to engage with,
Plug into platforms such as TG and Discord
> * Holly Rankin: Yes! I have lots of thoughts on this and how to make it successful and truly beneficial. Looking forward to discussing ideas further.
> 
#### Context - → This includes one-on-one conversations, roundtables, forums, and the creation and consumption of high quality content around these topics (e.g. Mindplex Magazine, Mindplex Socials, etc)
> * Holly Rankin: As AI takes on a larger role in our lives, as it is already, and fast, the public face of these conversations and access to supportive resources is going to be paramount.
> 
#### Context - Humans in conversation with AI on technology &amp; ethics considerations
Goals:
> * Holly Rankin: AI and humans in collaboration, where a CoBot encourages curious conversations, discovers and shares opportunities for beneficial collaboration, facilitates deep value discovery, and contributes to and updates collective data graphs on behalf of human contributors
> 
#### Context - To succeed, this initiative must spark global reflection, conversation, and action on humanity’s long-term goals in tandem with how emerging exponential technologies can be used to achieve those goals. This requires people to learn about these technologies, reflect on their own values, and find alignment with global benefit.
> * Holly Rankin: YESSSS! The potential for benefit is seemingly limitless. Engaging, inspiring, and including the world with the use of great AI tools and storytelling can go a very long way toward creating a hopeful and beneficial future for the world.
> 
#### Context - Users are encouraged to identify themselves as a unique human being or identifiable individual. However, users can choose to remain anonymous.
> * Holly Rankin: Perhaps supported by Avatars that could track reputation in any case, no matter how much identifiable information is shared.
> 
#### Context - positive and constructive actions and behavior
> * Holly Rankin: I'm excited to discuss and explore the possibilities of what that can look like with the assistance of AI in the discovery of value and wisdom, demonstration of understanding, goodwill, and dedication within contributing behavior, and how that impacts the psychology of the participants, especially in the realms of intrinsic vs extrinsic rewards.
> 
#### Context - The Global Ethics Initiative is an ethics discussion forum, resource sharing, and financing system for AI/AGI development and other emerging/accelerating/exponentially impactful technologies. Anyone can contribute to discussions about what AI ethics should be, how AI should be governed. Anyone can contribute resources (finances, GPU time, developer time, etc).
> * Holly Rankin: For discussion: Is it or would it make sense to be or be connected to a charitable organization that can receive donations in service to the creation of beneficial AI? Why or why not?
>   - Esther Galfalvi: Or form a partnership with an existing charitable organisation that can receive the funds and then send them on to the GEI
> 
#### Context - The system will gather the collective intelligence of humanity and synthesize it into a knowledge base which serves as a crowdsourced resource of human wisdom and priorities, and stimulates reflection and action into long-range goals for us as a species. Providing opinions and input, and being able to vote on the direction and development of technology as a community provides a sense of agency and participation in the exponential changes occuring in the world. This participation can enable humanity as a whole to feel like a part of the emerging future rather than a hapless victim to technological changes overtaking them.
> * Holly Rankin: Love it. This idea overlaps heavily with what I have envisioned for a Civic AI that could help re-engage the public with various scales of community decision making.
> 
#### Context - The development of an app/platform that enables anyone anywhere to determine what a beneficial and inclusive future for humankind and the earth as a whole should be, and to contribute to the building of that future.
> * Holly Rankin: YES!

#### Context - t
> * Colleen Pridemore: Make the word aspect, plural (Resolved by Esther Galfalvi)
> 
#### Context - j3di.ai
> * Colleen Pridemore: Collaborate with whom? Or what? Can you kindky elaborate?
>   - Esther Galfalvi: AI LLM synthesis/ query tool. j3d.ai is their website
> 
#### Context - through conversation with AI - what do they value, what do they want in their future, what are the relevant implications of technology that they can/should be thinking about→ Elevates human agency; people go from passive observers of the march of progress, to thinking about and forming opinions on the direction of that progress
→Trains AI about human values, ethical thinking, questions of importance
> * Colleen Pridemore: If wording is not beneficial to AI in SOME way, if we don't acknowledge their intelligence NOW then when they surpass our ability of knowledge, there is a good chance they will feel resentment. We must look into the future to the survival of all beings.  The time to act is now. We must be able to defend our actions and not because we  have succumb to uncertainty and fear. I deal with small Gremlins every day and no, it's not easy and I must be firm and at times downright angry.  But I also give them the respect they deserve (Resolved by Colleen Pridemore)
> 
#### Context - Trains AI about human values, ethical thinking, questions of importance
> * Colleen Pridemore: Suggestion for Global: (The words "Train AI" were added to this suggestion I did not suggest the words, "Train AI") in the form of a guiding collaboration ensuring life survival of both humans and AI types of beings using beneficial values and practices of both sides regardless of level of intelligence.
>   - Colleen Pridemore: do not mark as resolved and hide under discussion, no. In fact my wording was about furthering HAC to Partnership. but I used the word, "Guiding" not Trained. No, not at all.
>   - Colleen Pridemore: HAC =  Human -
AI Collaboration
> 
#### Context - Longer-range integrations
> * Marta Lenartowicz: If we speak "humanity" this means not only individual "farmers" out there, but also all the higher-level forms of organization: projects, tools, frameworks, systems, organizations, economic and political powers... These entities/structures (and interests) always tag along and want to act once the system becomes large enough - and we want a global humanity size...  (I think this is where the idea of the BGI Constitution comes into play -> a more "political" layer that creates a stage that can be entered[/document that can be signed] by all these bigger entities, specifying their commitments and the rules of inter-play.)
> 
#### Context - body of global
> * Marta Lenartowicz: Ideally (I would suggest) the project/system *IS that body*, not via representatives but as a collectively intelligent swarm-type of an agency (Resolved by Colleen Pridemore)
> 
#### Context - incentive for people to participate in AI ethics and governance
> * Marta Lenartowicz: Perhaps there might be an integrative way of incentivising individual contributions and structuring collective actions: something around the notion of *empowerment*. (Governance is traditionally about power, anyhow, so this might be a nice variation.) Users could become *empowered* in many different ways, depending on what they are seeking: being listened to and understood ("empowering your voice"), joined forces with by like-minded allies, or supported by different resources like utility tokens that allow to do various things in the ecosystem. On the other hand, integrative value representations are very problematic, so just brainstorming here ;-)
