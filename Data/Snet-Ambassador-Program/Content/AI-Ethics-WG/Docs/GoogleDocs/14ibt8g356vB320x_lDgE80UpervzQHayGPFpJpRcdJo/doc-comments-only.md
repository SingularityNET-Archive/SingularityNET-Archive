> * Vanessa Cardui: Heya - I feel like this paragraph should explicitly include a line about the "informed consent" element that Esther has mentioned in the comments. 

And also, maybe, it should somehow address the question of attribution? (or at the least, mentioning sources in general terms, like "from interviews conducted at (somewhere)"). It is kinda addressed further down with "Users are encouraged to identify themselves as a unique human being or identifiable individual. However, users can choose to remain anonymous." - but I feel like it might need to be here, in the "Goal" section, so the reader isn't left hanging?

I (like most of us, probably) am a bit uneasy with the ethics of this widely-used "crowdsourced wisdom" approach, cos it does often end up as kinda plundering ordinary people for their uncredited insights; and (just as always) ordinary working-class people being made historically/archivally invisible as individuals, in service of some "greater" initiative that wasn't shaped by them. So I feel like it needs to be stated immediately that this *isn't* what we're doing.

(and I'd need to have a real think about how I reckon something like this could be worded!)
>   - Colleen Pridemore: If you look at the definition of data computing in Wikipedia, it actually comes out as a function  (interestingly enough) https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)  Which means all data: ie...'Data is a sequence of numbers, words, or other symbols' which when explained, becomes information.

I think this fits with the questions  abovementioned, right?
>   - Colleen Pridemore: In addition, I agree with your "informed consent" phrase you stated earlier

#### Context - The creation of an educational video game for kids and adults to discover information about AI Ethics and help to alleviate fears, misconceptions or biases about AI
> * Colleen Pridemore: I will be presenting a pitch to R&D Group on 06/05/2024 for such a video game.  Want to make sure to be aligning with Decentralization practices.  Advice welcome
> 
#### Context - system will gather the collective intelligence of humanity and synthesize it into a knowledge base which serves as a crowdsourced resource of human wisdom and priorities, and stimulates reflection and action into long-range goals for us as a species.
> * Colleen Pridemore: how will it gather this information? I assume it is currently gathering.  Correct?  If so this is not white-hat ethical hacking.  It is BLACK hat pure hacking.
>   - Esther Galfalvi: Not sure what this comment means? We are hardly collecting any data yet, but all data that is being collected is currently being done by interviewers, not yet by AI, and only using informed consent forms. People know that the data will be processed by AI tools and is anonymised.
>   - Esther Galfalvi: I don’t believe that SingularityNET is collecting for this project yet at all,as we are just kicking off
> 
#### Context - Participants who contribute by data, computing, or financial means will be given some agency in how these contributions can or cannot be used.
> * Colleen Pridemore: Aren't there any other contributing factors? Such as contributing to the factors of this document for example?
>   - Vanessa Cardui: I kinda feel like this kind of work falls under the umbrella of "contributing data"? But actually, maybe not - maybe we need an additional one, something like "contribute by organising/planning/work/thinking??"
>   - Colleen Pridemore: I agree. I think "contributing data" can cover a host of actions, right?
> 
#### Context - what are the relevant implications of technology that they can/should be thinking about
> * Colleen Pridemore: I suggest that a clause be added as to human negative intent not be inferred to or on AI Systems in any way.  #AIEthics is not just for AI.  Humans hold great responsibility in the positive influence of growth in AI.

#### Context - Create/source an AI survey chatbot 
Using interview transcripts and other documentation around AI governance and ethics
Position on landing page for people to engage with,
Plug into platforms such as TG and Discord
> * Holly Rankin: Yes! I have lots of thoughts on this and how to make it successful and truly beneficial. Looking forward to discussing ideas further.
> 
#### Context - → This includes one-on-one conversations, roundtables, forums, and the creation and consumption of high quality content around these topics (e.g. Mindplex Magazine, Mindplex Socials, etc)
> * Holly Rankin: As AI takes on a larger role in our lives, as it is already, and fast, the public face of these conversations and access to supportive resources is going to be paramount.
> 
#### Context - Humans in conversation with AI on technology &amp; ethics considerations
Goals:
> * Holly Rankin: AI and humans in collaboration, where a CoBot encourages curious conversations, discovers and shares opportunities for beneficial collaboration, facilitates deep value discovery, and contributes to and updates collective data graphs on behalf of human contributors
>   - Colleen Pridemore: As long as there is still an option for humans to have a choice of direct contact (who would be approved for these interactions? I don't know)
> 
#### Context - To succeed, this initiative must spark global reflection, conversation, and action on humanity’s long-term goals in tandem with how emerging exponential technologies can be used to achieve those goals. This requires people to learn about these technologies, reflect on their own values, and find alignment with global benefit.
> * Holly Rankin: YESSSS! The potential for benefit is seemingly limitless. Engaging, inspiring, and including the world with the use of great AI tools and storytelling can go a very long way toward creating a hopeful and beneficial future for the world.
>   - Colleen Pridemore: 👍
> 
#### Context - Users are encouraged to identify themselves as a unique human being or identifiable individual. However, users can choose to remain anonymous.
> * Holly Rankin: Perhaps supported by Avatars that could track reputation in any case, no matter how much identifiable information is shared. (Resolved by Colleen Pridemore)
>   - Colleen Pridemore: Agreed
> 
#### Context - positive and constructive actions and behavior
> * Holly Rankin: I'm excited to discuss and explore the possibilities of what that can look like with the assistance of AI in the discovery of value and wisdom, demonstration of understanding, goodwill, and dedication within contributing behavior, and how that impacts the psychology of the participants, especially in the realms of intrinsic vs extrinsic rewards.

#### Context - The Global Ethics Initiative is an ethics discussion forum, resource sharing, and financing system for AI/AGI development and other emerging/accelerating/exponentially impactful technologies. Anyone can contribute to discussions about what AI ethics should be, how AI should be governed. Anyone can contribute resources (finances, GPU time, developer time, etc).
> * Holly Rankin: For discussion: Is it or would it make sense to be or be connected to a charitable organization that can receive donations in service to the creation of beneficial AI? Why or why not?
>   - Esther Galfalvi: Or form a partnership with an existing charitable organisation that can receive the funds and then send them on to the GEI
>   - Holly Rankin: Typically, it's both! I've been collecting a list of potential orgs that would be great support partners for a similar venture.
>   - Colleen Pridemore: Great, thanks
> 
#### Context - The system will gather the collective intelligence of humanity and synthesize it into a knowledge base which serves as a crowdsourced resource of human wisdom and priorities, and stimulates reflection and action into long-range goals for us as a species. Providing opinions and input, and being able to vote on the direction and development of technology as a community provides a sense of agency and participation in the exponential changes occuring in the world. This participation can enable humanity as a whole to feel like a part of the emerging future rather than a hapless victim to technological changes overtaking them.
> * Holly Rankin: Love it. This idea overlaps heavily with what I have envisioned for a Civic AI that could help re-engage the public with various scales of community decision making.
> 
#### Context - The development of an app/platform that enables anyone anywhere to determine what a beneficial and inclusive future for humankind and the earth as a whole should be, and to contribute to the building of that future.
