#### Context - including you!
> * Love Owokere: What happens if non-core contributors read this then?🫠 (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: I mean, they can read it - maybe they'd find it interesting - but they don't get the forms sent to them, so they can't take part.
If they accidentally get the forms somehow, I guess we'd check the names of those who complete the form against the list of those eligible?

I'm not sure what the thinking would be on whether they can attend the discussion meeting. I'd think prolly not - altho maybe they could attend as observers? Interesting question - maybe u should raise it?
>   - Love Owokere: I will once you send the doc out

#### Context - in Treasury Guild’s meeting on 18th April 2024, the following were suggested as  possible valid reasons:
> * Vanessa Cardui: I'm not sure whether to include this list - it might be seen as steering too much
>   - Love Owokere: Yup. Can we take it out?
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yup - done :-)

#### Context - where? Hmmm I am thinking these should actually be in the Archives, tho it was agreed in the past that they shouldn;t)
> * Love Owokere: Yeah it should. Is the sheet you are referring to here a total list of WG’s budget proposals from the past quarters or just last quarter?

The last quarter would do imo (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: actually, just realised they're all in Tevo's budget calculator sheet, in the 2nd and 3rd sheets :-)
>   - Love Owokere: Wawu, that's something 😅

#### Context - What is the background to this decision?
> * Vanessa Cardui: Unsure whether this section is better here, or at the end. 

Also, In it, I am trying to reference the decisions on all the elements of the process, for those who tend to ask "Well, when was THAT decided??" - but it does get quite wordy and complicated, so I dunno whether to do this, or just say simply how things are now.

I think I'll come back later today and restructure this section a bit so it starts with how it works now, then gives background (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Love Owokere: I think simply saying how things are now with tiny background information will do because some people might still not grasp so many details but then even that sounds wordy ;-)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yup... do u think what we've got now is too long?
>   - Love Owokere: Not to me but I don't know about others(who don't like reading :-)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: If there's one thing I ve learnt, it's "Never try to write for people who don't like reading" (and that applies to docs like this as much as it applies to poetry, lol)

So if this will be offputting for people who don't like reading (and I agree, it might be), does that mean that for accessibility, we need to present the info in another format too? And if so, what format?
>   - Love Owokere: If we make this into a summarized version it’s not going to explain things well so please let’s keep it this way. The way it’s currently arranged makes it easy to read or glance through
>   - Vanessa Cardui: ah, I meant, like - should we make a quick video, or a graphic or something?
>   - Love Owokere: Oh I get it now. I’m just wondering how I can work the words around in a graphic. A video is too much work and I don’t do good with videos 🫠

#### Context - additional questions about any objections
> * Vanessa Cardui: bit unsure how to word this.

I think people are on board with including these clarifying questions, but i dunno that we have agreed to actually call an objection "not valid" if the person can't show these thimgs - maybe that's next time?

But if we ARE going to say some objections are not valid, we need to tell people.

Any thoughts?

#### Context - . You will receive a separate Google form for each budget.
> * Vanessa Cardui: Is this right? Or will it be 1 form that tries to do each of them in turn?? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Love Owokere: I believe that 1 form will do. The other option will be time consuming
>   - Vanessa Cardui: true, it will - but it's not our decision, we're just writing the doc about it! Could you ask in Governance WG's Discord, and see if anyone's got an opinion?
>   - Love Owokere: I just asked about it
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Cool - thanks a mil
Tevo's reply in Gov WG Discord suggests that he's thinking yes, a separate form for each WG. 

It's kinda unwieldy I guess - but IMO less unwieldy than tryna get them all into 1 form. And it does ensure that people are actually looking at and paying attention to each WG's budget...
>   - Love Owokere: Yeah 
That makes sense. Though I see an incoming drama because of this semi scrutinity WGs might face 😂
> 
#### Context - this time, we will be using the tool CitizenOS (maybe include screenshots? or explain how people will log in - own account?)
> * Vanessa Cardui: unlikely, actually. It might just be google form again, unless we use Ethelo
>   - Vanessa Cardui: nope, it's google form
> 
#### Context - where it was decided
> * Vanessa Cardui: (I think it was decided in Treasury Guild, need to find it)
>   - Love Owokere: Separately? Omg, that's something. I didn't even notice this part:-)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yeh, but it might all be in the one google form...
"separately" was decided in Treasury Guild I think
> 
#### Context - Consent decision making process
> * Vanessa Cardui: Do we need to link to the Q1 budget decision, or will that just confuse things? (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: I could just pick a little information on the process from the last quarter’s doc and add it here to avoid confusion and people being too lazy to check any linked doc. Preferably under the “how the decision will be made” section
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yeh, that wd be great
