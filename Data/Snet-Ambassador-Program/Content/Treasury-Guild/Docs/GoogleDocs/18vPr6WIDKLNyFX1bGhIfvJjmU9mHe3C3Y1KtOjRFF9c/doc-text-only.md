# Server Side JSON Generator for Treasury

## This project aims to improve the SingularityNET Ambassador Program by

developing a server-side solution for generating transaction JSON files



## Our Current Problems

**High Computational Demand** : Most Ambassador Operators lack the computational power needed to generate JSON files efficiently.

**Limited Permissions Currently** , only hard-coded permissions can submit JSON files to the Treasury System, restricting flexibility and scalability.





**Deliverables:** (Key assets include)

**Cloud-Based JSON Generation** : Shift JSON validation and generation from Excel to a cloud server, allowing operators to submit data tables to the server for processing.

**API Integration** : Integrate Treasury Manager Excel with API requests

submitting data required for json building

receiving transaction hashes to confirm rewarded contributions

**Error Messaging** : Implement visual cues and error messages in Treasury Manager Excel

indicate potential submission failures

Display potential transaction errors

**Bundle Transaction Fitting** : Automatically divide large transactions into manageable parts to ensure we donâ€™t go over transaction size limits.

**Documentation** : Update Treasury System Documentation

Updated Process Map for Data movement directions https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOiDYnHs=/?moveToWidget=3458764538795540538&cot=10

New Excel Overview for Bundle Transaction Sheet

**Estimated Cost to achieve the goal:**



This project uses **Treasury Automation WG** as Category to identify this project costs





**Benefits:**

**Improved Efficiency** : Faster and more reliable JSON generation, reducing the computational burden on individual operators.

**Enhanced Flexibility** : Easier and permissionless contribution data submission process to the Treasury dApp

**Better Management** : New status for contributions ("Submitted for transaction") to manage and track transactions before payment.

## How to get onboarded?

**Express interest:** Reach out in the SingularityNET Discord server Treasury Guild channel to express your interest in joining the Treasury Guild. https://discord.gg/snet



**Join a meeting:** Attend a meeting, where you will be briefed about the project goals, strategy, and current activities. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions and clarify your role and responsibilities. Look for the Treasury Automation Workgroup meetings on the Ambassador Calendar. https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=singularitynetambassadors%40gmail.com&ctz=UTC



# Roadmap

Initially we kick off with Proposal introduction.

Then we Distribute deliverables and Roles and Schedule date and time for monthy stand up sessions.



In the first phase we update DoDcumentations so that we have appropriate research and knowledge on exact things we need build and which order. This may require additional meetings at early stage.



In the second phase we start developing and after a month or two we should be testing deliverables.



We will use Treasury Operator Workgroup Sessions for testing





# Documentation



Regular updates and detailed documentation will be maintained on the Miro Board and communicated through Discord channels. All team members will have access to the latest project information and can contribute to continuous improvement.
