# Treasury Guild

**Next Quarter:**

## This group aims to enhance the SingularityNET Ambassador Program by 

> [Comments]
> Context - enhance
> * Vanessa Cardui: Isn't it a bit more than this?

Yes, it "enhances" the program, and yes it structures the rules around payments - but doesn't Treasury Guild also manage actual payments and accounting (without which the program can't really operate)? (Resolved by Tevo Saks)
>

**Value Addition:**

Structuring Ambassador rules around payments, tasks and anything related to financial activities.

Provides space for members to learn and operate Treasury Funds.



**Goals:** Advise Ambassador Program budget requests and spending.



**Deliverables:** (Key assets include)

Meeting notes - for transparency and continuous learning

Proposals - for consistency and quality of output

Distribution documentation - Transaction metadata auditing, registering and analyzing.

Tooling to make reward distribution easier (Also provided by Swarm Treasury Guild Service)

Treasury Manager Updates

Tooling to make decision-making easier (Also provided by Swarm Treasury Guild Service)

> Context - Tooling to make decision-making easier
> * Vanessa Cardui: I feel like there needs to be something additional here around peer education within the team on decision-making processes? so the facilitators, particularly, are aware of different ways to make decisions on Treasury issues, and ways to ensure voices are heard? (i.e. it's not just tooling)
But I also think this might be seen as out of scope. What do you both think? (Resolved by Ambassadors SingularityNET)
>   - Tevo Saks: Here I listed that point for example the Power BI updates. The process and practices hopefully come about while we have the discussions.
Not sure how would we turn into a deliverable or into clear paragraph as its usually an emergent activity or need

> * Vanessa Cardui: Planning and facilitating these should be costed. Is it included in your facilitation budget? I'm pretty sure not, but I could be misreading. I would suggest a separate "Training" budget line? (Resolved by Tevo Saks)
>   - Tevo Saks: Yep thats costed with line"Â Twelve up to 120min Treasury Operations workshops"

Additional budget that may be required:

Async Onboarding - 4h - 10$/hr (total 40$)

Unplanned Documentation and Activities budget - 20h - 20$/hr (total 400$)



Extra costs:

Swarm Treasury Guild Service Fee. Up to 800 USD per month. (percental reduction from 0.35 AGIX price)

## Roles and Skills Required

**Facilitators**

Facilitator rewards are distributed among all facilitators per month based on a percentage of their participation in recurring meetings.

> Context - distributed among all facilitators per month
> * Vanessa Cardui: Sorry, I know I am missing something here - but why would we not just directly pay whoever facilitates each meeting? (Resolved by Ambassadors SingularityNET)
>   - Tevo Saks: Trying new a method to incentivize facilitation and consistency. The problem with the previous result was one-off facilitation, but lacked consistency in the meetings where there was not their turn to facilitate.
I assume this would low-key reward for participating in meetings or cut-off those who only do things if its rewarded right away.

It has this gaming element, too; the more facilitators, the fewer rewards for everybody. So, ideally, it finds its balance.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: ok fair enough - worth a try!
>

Facilitation is rotational. Postponing facilitation without an agreed swap of facilitator will cause a loss of rewarded role for participation.



Activities:

Planning, facilitating and creating meeting summary for Treasury Guild meetings.

Facilitating Treasury Guild operation workshops.



**Treasury operators**

Importing, cleaning and auditing Ambassador Program tasks.



**Content creators**

Creating guiding material about the rules and decisions taken in the Treasury Guild.

> * Vanessa Cardui: is this deffo the right form? It seems to go to a form about signing up to audit WGs, not to get training for Treasury Operations (Resolved by Ambassadors SingularityNET)
>   - Tevo Saks: to me its the same thing
>   - Vanessa Cardui: oh - wild :-)
I woulda thought that learning to actually *do* the Treasury operations is a kinda neutral role - you'd just manage the transactions, and not comment - whereas auditing (or rather, monitoring?) what WGs are actually doing is a different thing, and not neutral?

So not the same thing - but ok, if they are linked, then OK, but I reckon that wants some thinking about. And there should probably be some kind of published guidelines about **how** WGs are audited by this team. For example, what elements of WG budgets are up for scrutiny? And on what basis - e.g. looking at what they said they would do vs what they actually, do, looking at timeliness of their spending, looking at who is paid for what, verifying that work has been done - or what? And if someone who is not an "auditor" (or whatever we call them) has a concern, where and how do they officially raise it? And are there elements of a WG's budget that are not up for scrutiny? (sometimes I think we do a bit too much nitpicking, and it's stressful for WG leads to have agreed budgets constantly being picked at...) And so on...
>   - Tevo Saks: We had this discussion on Tuesday. I was also first at impression we are going to have basically 3 teams, auditors, operators and then general meetings.
However, due to the capacity and complication of the question you raised, we decided to focus on the Swarm Treasury Guild side on making the treasury operations transparent, and it has this low-key auditing in place.

Although we don't rely much on enforcing rules.
I think we have many issues, but raising them quite a challenge and people usually are able to defend themselves quite well and most of the time nitpicking leads for people to quit what their doing.

As for now the auditing role would bring more awarenessÂ on the issues we have when we try to transform and clarify the quality of task recognition.

Peter also expects that this role is not rewarded.
So getting any third party eye on things, most likely is out of question too.

However combining it with operations and putting people into driver seat of cleaning and validating tasks is rewarded.

TLDR: for Q1 we open up operations calls and provide people opportunity to learn treasury manager and have hands on experience cleaning and validating tasks.

If this is still not enough we can come back to this again find ways to have this auditing group
>   - Vanessa Cardui: hmm - I see the point, but not totally convinced.

I still think the roles (validating transactions, vs actual oversight of WGs' budgets) should be notionally separate, because they are so different - even if it's broadly the same group of people doing both things. So people would need to be clear in what capacity they are doing a particular action.

And I still think there should be some kind of community-wide agreement on what we think is valid to question/challenge, and on what basis, when it comes to budgets. I think that would help avoid both over-nitpicking, and the opposite.

But yeh, let's give it a go, and maybe bear my points in mind?

**Join a meeting:** Attend a meeting, where you will be briefed about the workgroupâ€™s goals, strategy, and current activities. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions and clarify your role and responsibilities. Look for the Treasury Guild meeting on the Ambassador Calendar. https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=singularitynetambassadors%40gmail.com&ctz=UTC



**Check meeting notes:** Workgroup agendas and notes are taken on the Miro Board - volunteering to take notes is a good way to onboard yourself. Each yellow-boxed window is a meeting note area, where the meeting summaries and video are in the top right corner. https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM7pbrKE=/?moveToWidget=3458764571589493326&cot=10

# Roadmap

Help each existing workgroup and guild to get some sort of Proposal out. 

> [Comments]
> Context - get some sort of Proposal out
> * Vanessa Cardui: Is this a proposal about their overall work and scope, do u reckon? Or more about what they propose to do for a given Quarter? (Resolved by Ambassadors SingularityNET)
>   - Tevo Saks: I would say both
>   - Vanessa Cardui: OK cool - I guess I just mean is it something you'd see as a one-off, to be done when the WG is first set up; or something that needs to be re-done each Quarter? (Maybe as part of their quarterly reports, and/or their budget submissions?)

I'm guessing the latter?
>   - Ambassadors SingularityNET: It could be even a continues thing each quarter. It depends on the participant needs if they need help
>

Provide space for further treasury discussions

# Documentation

The team will manage the workgroup through regular virtual meetings, and coordination on Discord.  Documentation will be maintained on the Miro Board https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN8kUlbw=/
