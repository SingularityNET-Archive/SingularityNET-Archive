# Default System Criteria to Recognize Core Contributor

Time-based Recognition

Participate or Contribute 12 hours in the last 6 months 

> [Comments]
> Context - Participate or Contribute 12 hours in the last 6 months
> * Ambassadors SingularityNET: Changed to also include contribute. I think every previous time also did not filter out contributions when I calculated hours.
If we would also require just participation regardless the amount of contribution, then list would look even smaller (maybe it should)
Because many contributors are only in visit their own WG sessions
>

Contribute at least 6 hours in the last 6 months

Has to have any activity at least in the last 3 months

Fund Request Recognition

Be rewarded with 1000+ AGIX for contributions in the last 3 months



# Alternative Core Contributor Recognitions

Allow anyone to nominate or apply to be a core contributor.

No clear process has been implemented, we will come up with it based on the demand and interest.

For initial implementation: publish a list of core contributors and have a week period for further manual nominations. To be confirmed by the initial list, through discussion. Aim to be lenient initially.



Contributor List will be aggregated as an Excel list going forward
