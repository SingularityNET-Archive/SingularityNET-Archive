# Gov Sandbox Turn #1 - Testing Tools



### Purpose

Test different online decision making tools at different use cases in the SingularityNET Ambassadors Program.



**Introduction:**

In today's tech landscape, effective governance for AI is crucial. At SingularityNET, we value responsible governance in deploying AI innovations. We propose a Governance Sandbox to evaluate decision-making tools within the Ambassadors program, leveraging community feedback to refine practices for transparency and accountability. The Sandbox will test scalable tools aligned with our values of decentralization and ethical AI utilization. This proposal outlines our objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes for implementing a Governance Sandbox within SingularityNET's ecosystem.





**Tools to evaluate**



**CitizenOS** Off chain discussion platform, using form templates and commenting features. Two streams: discussion and voting, not integrated. Can use ID checks for "hard" voting.

> * Colleen Pridemore: To me, this looks like a good place to start to be able to include Entities and Sentients both.  I like the UI and it seems very friendly for all.

**Loomio** Off-chain discussion platform using a form template and commenting features. Offers options on voting on proposals (sense check, advice, consent, consensus, and rating on a scale). Starts with discussion, and then a vote or decision can be appended to the discussion. https://www.loomio.com/



**Ethelo** Potentially on-chain survey and discussion platform, using AI analytics.

**Governance Sandbox Evaluation Framework**

Objectives: Identify and prioritize governance challenges, test decision-making tools, and engage Ambassadors for feedback.

Key Metrics: Usability, transparency, and effectiveness of tools will be assessed.

Methodology: Select and pilot test tools, gather feedback through surveys and interviews, and analyze performance.

Stakeholder Engagement: Active participation of Ambassadors and broader community input will be sought.

Evaluation Criteria: User experience, transparency, and decision outcomes will be evaluated.

Data Collection and Analysis: Quantitative data on tool usage and qualitative feedback will inform iterative refinement.

Reporting: Regular updates and a final evaluation report will summarize findings and recommendations.



**Documentation to be developed about the study**



Implementation Guide: Details setup steps for the Governance Sandbox in SingularityNET, covering tool selection, Ambassador engagement, data collection, and iterative refinement.

Evaluation Report: Summarizes findings, user feedback, tool performance metrics, and scaling recommendations for effective governance in SingularityNET.

User Manual for Governance Tools: Provides practical instructions and guidelines for Ambassadors on tool usage, navigation, and troubleshooting during and post evaluation.

**Action Items**

Ambassadors Upcoming decision on Q2



1. Concrete Use cases

### Decision to make

1) Ambassadors Naming Thing

2) Q2 Budget Allocation

3) Quarterly deadline for budget submissions



Question for the community https://citizenos.com/





2. Simulated scenarios

Purely testing platforms

****

**Confirm Participation** Guilds / WG







****

**Criteria**

UX

Dashboard suitability

Privacy?

Who is part of the simulation?



**Concerns**

Transparency



### How we do it

1) Define which tools for which decision

2) Setup Decision making group (Ambassadors/Contributors/Workgroup members)

3) Test the Tool with the group

4) Reflect and Analyze

5) Create and share reports







**DF Use Cases**

Dispute resolution

Partnership approval

Fast consensus

Ideation

Location for the DF circles meeting

How much budget to allocate on the next DF Round

Quick poll

KYC to participate in DF, only verified profiles should be able to participate on DF and aloud to vote

Refreshing circles status (e.g. starting a new circle or project: circle goal; who is involved, does there need to be a leader, etc)

Tevo: btw, just finished call with Josh from UNANIMOUS AI (the link you shared above)



next week they can train us on using the tool if we want to

and I have an idea what we could use it for

Question for the community https://citizenos.com/



### When we do it

In April 2024



### What do we measure ?



**Q2 budget decisions:** use a consent process (which I think the Citizen OS tool allows).We do the decision for each WG’s budget separately.



**Explanatory text/framing (if there is space for it in Citizen OS)**  You are being asked for your consent to this budget request from (XXXX Workgroup) for Q2 2024. (include link to budget doc)



This is a consent decision-making process - so you are not being asked if the budget is perfect, but simply whether or not you consider it "safe to proceed".  If there are any objections, this will be discussed in a Treasury meeting where he objector and the WG will be invited to try to agree on changes in order to remove those objections - so this form also asks you what would need to change in order for you to give your consent.



The closing date to give your decision is:



Do you consent to this budget?

Yes, I consent - it's ok to proceed

No, I do not consent - it'S NOT ok to proceed

I don't want to take part in this decision - I abstain



Then conditional formatting, if the tool allows it:

If you do not consent,

What is/are your objection(s)?

“What would need to change in order for you to give your consent?”



if you do consent:

“Are there any concerns you'd like to raise, which are not strong enough to make you withhold your consent, but that you would still like to share? If not, please write "no concerns".



So it’s like this https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRPU26UXer7i0a5rNUo1njrZwnhjrOfFMcClGBYBVcfjQGyw/viewform







Notes:

Citizen OS seems not the best match for the current Contributors decision making.

Suggestion:

Stick with current tools nd build upon the Q1 Budget allocation decisionam making.



Improvements

How to ensure anonymity of people

How would the Proposal affect people/groups
