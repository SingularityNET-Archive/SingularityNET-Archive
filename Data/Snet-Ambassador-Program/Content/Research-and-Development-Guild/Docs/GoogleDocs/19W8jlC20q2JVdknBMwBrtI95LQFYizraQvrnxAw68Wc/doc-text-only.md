## RoadMap and Operations



## R&D Guild Q3 Update Proposal &

## Q2 Community Concern Response

****

On behalf of the R&D Guild, we address concerns from the community. We are pleased to share a message approved by the guild members. We commit to delivering tangible solutions and deliverables to the ambassadors. We have diligently worked on developing proposals and aim for high transparency about our actions.



As detailed in our Q1 report, the beginning of 2024 involved reorganizing objectives, responsibilities, and planning. We initiated the development of artifacts in the project pipeline, following established procedures. Our initial focus was on starting operations, not final deliverables. Now, with the operations structure in place, we can make firmer commitments.



**Taking into account the concerns presented in the last quarter, we believe it is convenient to establish the following criteria to move forward with operations.**

****

**1. Operations / GitHub Operations Status:** We have updated our GH operations with 6 new repos, 1 per proposal in execution to begin ordering deliverables for this end of Q2. All team interactions and collaborations within proposals will be addressed and have a register to enhance the results and output of developments. ****

**2. Deliverables per proposal:** If by the closing date of Q2 the teams involved in the development proposal do not present progress in the assigned repositories and their respective reports with details of the progress and status, the resources assigned to said proposals will not be disbursed and will be reevaluated. their allocation to new projects on the waiting list. The budget and proposal for the next Guild Q3 will be reviewed and updated based on new allocations.

At the next meeting on Wednesday, June 19, the status of the proposals under development will be updated and the report will be updated according to the results presented by the teams.



**3. Internal Deadline:** Deadlines for submission of new proposals; In consequence of what happened at the end of Q1 and the presentation of the Q2 budget, the members of the guild agree on a deadline to present new proposals internally to be evaluated with due time to be agreed upon and incorporated into the final Guild budget.



**4. Team Collaborations:** Minimum of 2 members per proposal; According to the lack of progress in some of the proposals in the pipeline, the members of the guild agree that the proposals should present a team in charge of development of at least two members.



**5. Proposal Timelines and Milestones Deliverables and description:** Proposals need to include a detailed milestone deliverables and description, roadmap and timeline for being approved. This will help to achieve objectives on calendar and an easy understanding for evaluation and setting expectations within the guild and the community members.

Proposals in development should incorporate a timeline with estimated development times and milestone deliverables. New proposals must incorporate this item into the proposals to be presented to the Guild.



**6. Community Decision:** As our guild is building for the community we need to include the community in deciding the order in priority of what we build with the resources allocated to our operations. Starting this Q3 we will have the community to vote on which of the proposals should be next on the pipeline.



**Q3 Budget Update**



Notes: R&D Q3 Budgate incorporates a special allocation to support ” **Metta** page, there will be a doc and playground page being launched shortly, input on it before golive would be welcome. & OSS from foundation would be projects like opencog, but also blockchain infra like staking portal, voting portal, bridge (these aren't yet oss but might become in future). ”   proposals or needs of @singularityNET, the ecosystem: Allocation for supporting upcoming open source initiatives from SingularityNET foundation. We'll keep extra singuarityNET needs upon complemetary budget that should come from fundation. **Contingency budget** works on the idea of ​​determining a reserve within the budget to be prepared for any eventuality outside the initial scope. If its use is not necessary, the budget will be maintained in the Guild's reserves as a cumulative supplementary fund.
