Notes

Intent: This short form template is designed for a proposal to the **R&D Guild** of the Ambassador Program, within the Singularity Net ecosystem. It is more of a suggestion, hopefully a starting point.The format may fit a project with 1-2 participants, lasting one or a couple of months, and with a tentative budget of $200-$2,000. We ask for this type of proposal to take the reviewer no more than 15-30 minutes to study and respond to.

Short means a total word count of well under 500 or even under 200. Since we expect you to focus on a familiar subject, with the initiative already researched and planned, the form should take less than an hour to complete.We totally appreciate any feedback, positive or otherwise, regarding your experiences preparing a Proposal for the R&D Guild, whether you use this Template or not.
