Hello @CoreContributors



🛠️ R&D Guild Q2 budget concern response



On behalf of the R&D Guild, we address concerns from the community. We are pleased to share a message approved by the guild members. We commit to delivering tangible solutions and deliverables to the ambassadors. We have diligently worked on developing proposals and aim for high transparency about our actions.



As detailed in our Q1 report, the beginning of 2024 involved reorganizing objectives, responsibilities, and planning. We initiated the development of artifacts in the project pipeline, following established procedures. Our initial focus was on starting operations, not final deliverables. Now, with the operations structure in place, we can make firmer commitments.



As noted in the Q1 report and Q2 meeting minutes, the construction stage has begun, we've switched to GitHub for project management, and will incorporate repositories into Q2 deliverables.

**GH operations with 6 new repos, 1 per proposal in execution to begin ordering deliverables for Q2.**





Thank you to the community for trusting our ability to build and improve the guild's results. We value our teamwork and the challenges we face together.





Let's keep building!
