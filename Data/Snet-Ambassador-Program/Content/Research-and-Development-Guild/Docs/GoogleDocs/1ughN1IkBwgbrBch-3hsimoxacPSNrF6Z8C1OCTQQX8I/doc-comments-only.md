#### Context - Ambassadors Program
> * Vanessa Cardui: This doc is (according to its title)Â  for, and about, improving R&D Guild.
Not convinced that a survey of the broader Ambassador Program would tell you much about improving R&D specifically. WGs are all quite specific, and insights from someone involved in other groups might not translate well to R&D.

#### Context - productivity within the broad program
> * Vanessa Cardui: Hey Ayo - as you asked me for input via DM back in June, for completeness I'm adding my comments here :-)

OK so In a program such as this, I'm not even sure I agree that "productivity", in and of itself, is a universal good. I'm not saying productivity is bad as such - just that it's not the point, and it's probably not something we want to enshrine as an aim.
Productivity is usually a dreary, Taylorist "time and motion" kind of thing - a measure of how efficiently you convert inputs (usually labour and money) into outputs (products and services). 

For a start, we're not entirely here to produce "products and services" anyway - and even when we do, it depends what you mean by "inputs" (in our context I think it's broader than just labour and money) and it depends what you mean by "efficiency" (An approach that is "efficient", in a community like this, is probably going to miss a lot; and we have other values than efficiency, such as inclusion, engagement, innovation, ability to take risks and try things out, and degree of decentralisation, that we would probably want to foreground.

In short, focus on "productivity" (and by implication, "efficiency") is an **ethos**, not a universal truth; and it's not an ethos that necessarily fits here. It shoulkd be recognised as an ethos, and we need to follow the thinking through to the end and look at what kind of community it would lead us to.

#### Context - One of the statutory ways we reward productivity is to confer a core contributor status.
