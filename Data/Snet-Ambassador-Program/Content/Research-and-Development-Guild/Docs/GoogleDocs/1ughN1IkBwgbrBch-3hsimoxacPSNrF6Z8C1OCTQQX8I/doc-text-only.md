**How To Improve What About The R&D Guild of the SNet Ambassadors Program (Ayo).**





The research and development guild of the SNet Ambassador’s program was  created to “work with different workgroups and guilds and satisfy their development and research needs (i.e. Automation tools, Dashboards, Educational content, Framework designs, DApps,...)”.



And in the pursuit of this purpose two of the expected outcomes include

“Enhanced capabilities of Ambassadors in promoting SingularityNET” and “Increased collaboration and innovation within the SingularityNET community.”



To this effect it is safe to say that anything that helps the guild achieve the purposes for which it was instituted better and more efficiently has helped the guild to be better.



One of the things I believe the guild must consider is the members productivity within the broad program.The program already has ways by which it measures productivity, But there is yet more to be uncovered. One of the statutory ways we reward productivity is to confer a core contributor status . Sometimes the productivity yardsticks vary, but nevertheless the whole concept does revolve around productivity.



And in following this line it’s become my thought that if we understood how people attained the levels of rewardable productivity in the program, then we might be able to discern how to improve it. Once we improve productivity we’ve directly and indirectly improved everything else.



On the surface, this task or research quest may seem like it is solely about productivity but it is definitely much more, productivity is just the string to the whole yarn .





My Suggestion:Conduct a Productivity Study within members of the Ambassadors Program both active or inactive. Consider about 15 survey questions.  For example we should from our questions be able to determine how long it takes an average member to attain the core contributor status . We must be able to ascertain what factors are responsible . What the size of the bell curve is. What factors are responsible for the positive outlier-ing ?  How to imbibe and engender such factors so that we may slim our productivity bell curve? And not to forget to mention all the other un-preempted exposes we may uncover .



It is both my conviction and informed opinion that the results of this research (if conducted) will provide the Guild with an improvement Map of for the Guild that will spread right through the whole Ambassadors Program.



Comments, Suggestions and Questions are welcome.

Thank you so much.
