## 1. Introduction:

This initiative aims to create a comprehensive list of members, their skill sets, and availability. By doing so, we intend to foster deeper collaboration. The database will be a valuable resource for onboarding workgroups, promoting synergy within the ecosystem, and driving future collaboration efforts.

The Collaboration Skills Database initiative will be a cornerstone in fostering deeper collaboration within the SingularityNet Ambassador Program guild & work groups. By systematically collecting and leveraging the skill sets of our members, we will unlock new possibilities for innovation and synergy. This proposal outlines the steps required to establish the database, coordinate with onboarding workgroups, develop a collaboration strategy, and engage with potential participants. Together, we can create a more connected, innovative, and successful community.

First steps will be using the data collected through the Ambassador Program getting-started participant and the Expert group candidates
