#### Context - Privacy Preferences: Comment: Consider the balance between sharing information for collaboration and maintaining individual privacy. Think about what controls or options you would want to have over your own profile and data visibility.Question: What preferences or controls do you believe are essential for users to manage their privacy and the visibility of their profiles within the organization?
