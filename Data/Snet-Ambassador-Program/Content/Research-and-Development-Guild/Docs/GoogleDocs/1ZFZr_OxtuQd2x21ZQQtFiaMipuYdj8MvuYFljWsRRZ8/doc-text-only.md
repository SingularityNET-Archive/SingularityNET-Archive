From the first session on we started collecting Q1 Ambassador Program needs and transformed them into concrete proposals for creating artifacts and tools to help the Ambassadors efforts.

Proposals were discussed internally for later budget requests.

Members of the team participate in consecutive meetings with the Treasury working to fit the development needs into treasury budget possibilities.
