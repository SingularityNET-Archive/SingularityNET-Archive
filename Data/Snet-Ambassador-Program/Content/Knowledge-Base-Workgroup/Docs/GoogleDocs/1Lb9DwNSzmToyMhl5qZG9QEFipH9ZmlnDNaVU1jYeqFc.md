# Measures and Metrics

**Objective:** To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Knowledge Base Workgroup, we will employ a set of clear, quantifiable metrics. These will help us track progress, identify areas for improvement, and ensure alignment with our goals.



Document Metrics

Total Documents Found: Track the number of relevant documents and resources identified by the Content Aggregators. This metric will measure our capability in resource identification and collection.

Documents Uploaded to GitBook: Count the number of documents successfully uploaded and organized in GitBook. This will indicate our efficiency in making information accessible to ambassadors.

Documents Excluded from GitBook: Monitor the number of documents identified but not included in GitBook. This measure helps in understanding the relevance and quality control processes of our content curation.

Content Analysis

Quality of Documents: Implement a rating system for each document based on relevance, clarity, and utility. Regularly review and update document ratings to maintain high-quality content in GitBook.

Facilitator Engagement

Guest Facilitators Count: Record the number of guest facilitators involved in our workshops and meetings. This metric will reflect our success in engaging external experts and diversifying our knowledge base.

Workgroup Performance

Milestone Completion Rate: Evaluate the completion rate of set milestones against the planned timeline. This will indicate the workgroup's efficiency and ability to meet targets.

# Roadmap
