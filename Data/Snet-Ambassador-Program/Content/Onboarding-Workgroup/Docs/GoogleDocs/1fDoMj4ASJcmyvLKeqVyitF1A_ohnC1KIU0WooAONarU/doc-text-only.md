@Gorga Siagian what do you mean by that?

14:29:06 From V to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



That is a very serious accusation, Gorga. I think maybe there is a need to address your constant unfounded accusations outside of the WG?

outside of meetings I mean?

I'm so tired of hearing that accusation from him

Not sure what representing your country has to do with accusations of favouritism?

14:31:45 From V to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



I am very close to raising this as an issue for moderation/complaint, Gorga. You can't just run around making unfounded accusations of racism, xenophobia, favouritism etc and then go "Hehee" about it as if it's not a serious issue.

14:31:53 From Gorga Siagian to Everyone:

@V i am not racism vani, i express this because lately i have shown my interest in becoming a facilitator and documenting, always rejected. when someone else becomes a facilitator and documenting is immediately approved, can you explain why this happen?

14:36:07 From V to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



@Gorga Siagian I would imagine that if people are being "rude"  it's because they think you are being really out of order, Gorga - and I would agree. . I've raised this with you 1-2-1 in the past when you accused me quite nastily of xenophobia for daring to correct your meeting summary - you aplogised, but clearly you have not changed.



I think we need to take this further, as clearly you have complaints and issues to raise.

14:37:04 From Ayo Olu-Ayoola to Everyone:

We don't have quite a bit of time o

14:37:21 From Gorga Siagian to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



I am not out of the rules vani, I must know why the reason for my interest in being a documentarian and facilitator was previously rejected, even I have asked duke to be my mentor and was also rejected, when others showed the same interest as me, they were immediately accepted. Then if the facilitator and documenting schedule has been determined why not just show it. @vani

14:37:24 From Love Owokere to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a…"

@V Agreed

14:37:24 From V to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



@Gorga Siagian Can I explain why *what* happened, Gorga? You *have* documented meetings, and you did it so poorly that we actually had to assign someone else to re-do your work. Pwerhaps that is why.

And Gorga, what do you mean "why not just show it?" (the roster)? I t is right there, at the top of the agenda - you can see it for yourself.

14:39:31 From Gorga Siagian to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



@V Yes, I have been a documenter once, but when I showed interest in being a documenter or facilitator, I was always rejected again, and when Onize and Ayo(sorry for mentioning names) showed me being a documenter and facilitator the second time, I was always accepted, I want to know what the reason is?

14:39:44 From Ayo Olu-Ayoola to Everyone:

@Gorga Siagian please be patient.

14:40:08 From V to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



You've been a documenter TWICE. Both times your work was very poor.

Yes, I know that's why I needed a mentor and asked Duke and he was willing to do it, but when I showed interest in being a facilitator, I was always rejected even though I had never carried out that role.

14:43:15 From Gorga Siagian to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



I remember when I showed my interest in playing one of those two roles, love always said NO, I don't know why she said that, so I had to say this before Q3 started

14:44:42 From V to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



Yes, Gorga. Because, as we have explained to you several times, **there is a roster**.



You cannot jump over someone else who is already assigned to the task.



We make the roster **quarterly**.



At the start of Q2 you were not eligible to be on it.



You've had this explained to you several times - please could you pay attention to the replies you get when you ask a question?

@Gorga Siagian Nobody has said you are racist, Gorga. We have said that you repeatedly make unfounded accusations of racism against other people.



As I said - **please** can you make some effort to pay attention to what is actually being said to you?

14:46:04 From Gorga Siagian to Everyone:

Replying to "have the 4 mentors a..."



When there is a roster, why doesn't  show it? I already said it above

14:46:42 From V to Everyone:

Gorga, I just told you above. The roster is visible in the agenda doc - it is RIGHT THERE. Just open it and read it.

@Gorga Siagian You said "You need to know guys, I'm not racist at all, I support everything you do, but when something is unfair and not transparent we have to say it, right?"



There is NOTHING that is "unfair and not transparent" here. This is about you, I think.

I even asked Duke to mentor me to be a facilitator when needed but it didn't materialize until the end of Q2, but that's okay

@SucrenSpice it seems sucre, because I have repeatedly expressed my interest in being in one of those roles and someone always says no, and when someone is interested in one of those roles they are immediately accepted

14:51:49 From V to Everyone:

Replying to "Too many banter thes..."



this isn't just bantz imo. The problem seems to be that Gorga thinks it is - he thinks it is trivial to accuse people of racism and untransparency.
