#### Context - documents Clement suggested should be written
> * Vanessa Cardui: For reference, can you say what docs these were?
>   - Dr Ayo Olu-Ayoola: One: Scripts from which onboarding video guide can be made.
Two: An update/upgrade on the "getting started".
>   - Vanessa Cardui: they both already exist :-)

#### Context - having a smooth and engaging video
> * Vanessa Cardui: I kinda feel we already have 2 "smooth and engaging videos" tho? There's the "slides and voiceover" one that Duke did, and the Welcome video.Â  How many more videos do we need?
>   - Love Owokere: I don't think we need more tbh, we could just update the information on the videos quarterly or whenever necessary.
