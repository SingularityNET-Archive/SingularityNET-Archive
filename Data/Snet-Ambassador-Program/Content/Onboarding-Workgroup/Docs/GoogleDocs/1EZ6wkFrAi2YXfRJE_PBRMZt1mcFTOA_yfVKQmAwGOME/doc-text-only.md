**Feedback Submission: Improving Onboarding Processes through Complaints and Suggestions**



****



Hello, I am Ayo. As I suggested during the session, following up on Duke’s comments, we could consider having a smooth and engaging video. I also volunteered to help with writing the video script and the documents Clement suggested should be written. All to the effect that the onboarding processes can be seamless so that new members on entry can easily find out what’s next for them at every step of the way.



Hello, My name is Love(aka LadyTempestt). Here are a few suggestions we made a few days ago to enhance our onboarding sessions:

Should we have onboarding sessions at all? or should we focus on doing it more 1-2-1?

Should we do what the survey respondents seem to be suggesting, and have weekly sessions? We wouldn't have capacity

Should part of each onboarding meeting be a mini "onboarding Q&A"?

Would it be more helpful to share our existing resources - e.g. the voiceover **video** of the onboarding slides, that Duke did?

There is a budget for Sucre to delegate some 1-2-1 onboarding engagement work; would that help?

Was the reason that we didn't have attendees this time just because there had not recently been any big influx of new people?



(Vani) I’d say the main barriers for new people are a) not knowing which WG would be a good fit for them and b) not really understanding the decentralised nature of the program. Perhaps b) is best addressed by more educational resources on decentralised governance - infographics, short explainer videos, etc - but I think it’s something that you can’t just tell people once and they’ll get it. It’s a process, and it’s part of the “continuous onboarding” concept that this WG identified via our research during Q3 and Q4 2023. We should keep all that research work in mind! As for a) - I’m thinking some of this could be addressed by the 1-2-1 work that Sucre does already, and maybe that needs a couple more people and a bit more resourcing - but also, maybe our “skills audit” approach (which atm we are doing just internally for this WG) could be a wider thing, that all new people are invited to do? And/or, maybe we need a Discord channel for “say what skills you want to use here”, where everyone (not just new people actually) can post “At the moment I’d like to be using XYZ skill” and WGs can say “Ah, we have an opportunity for you”; or WG leads could post “We need someone with XYZ skill”.



(Vani) We also need to think about language barriers - do we need to translate the onboarding resources we create, add video subtitles in several languages, etc? (Maybe this is part of a collab with e.g. LatAm Guild?)



(Vani) Just as an aside: we also need to bear in mind that some people prefer info as text. Most native speakers of a language can read twice or 3 times as fast as they can listen to spoken word. So for me anyway, having to sit thru a video rather than just read the info is kinda wasting my time, lol. So if we have videos, we should make the transcript available.



(Vani) Referencing my point 3 above - there’s quite a lot of work that Onboarding WG has already done, that newer people might not be aware of. We want to avoid reinventing the wheel. So I’m feeling that we need a knowledge base **for the Onboarding WG itself** , with all the thinking and resources already created, that new people can go and look at. It could be kept on the Ambassador GitBook, actually.



(Love aka ladytempestt here again) **a** ) I feel some of us are too focused on getting paid for tasks we do instead of **adding actual value and doing the job right.**  **b** ) I also think that some suggestions brought here could be very useful in another WG, so maybe we need to start aligning skills and ideas with fitting WGs so people interested can manifest the ideas in the right direction. **c** ) It's worth reminding everyone that this WG doesn't have to be your last bus stop in the ambassador program, please feel free to explore and shine outside here.

I'm **Sucre** . My thoughts:  Have a mini category on Discord that says **Onboarding.** Under this category, we will have: A. “landing pad’’ for those who come into the program. See if we can get a bot to notify us of their arrival and welcome them  and point them to the getting started channel for next steps. Then, a role is assigned to them. Like a **newbie role or tag. This could be a certain color so they are easily identifiable.** B. Revamp the information on the getting started channel- no more introductory task, no more signing up to be an Ambassador.(the role isn’t there anymore). Update the useful links and FAQ sectionsC. Sign up on Dework. Create and submit a Cardano based wallet address. Link our calendar to your personal calendar to get links and times of all meetings. D. Get an overview of all workgroups and guilds in the programE. Fill in the Skills Doc F. Get assigned to an onboarder. (Onboarders are different from workgroup members. The job of the onboarder is to have a 1-2-1 interaction with the newbies, ensuring that the above steps have been done. Answer any questions they may have and direct or suggest  to them to a WG that could be the best fit for them in the program).





Hello there. These are inputs from **Cjfrankie** .

From a birds-eye view, our onboarding interface isn't overwhelming.  My 70-year-old grandmother can pass these onboarding phases.

In the event that users need assistance during onboarding but find it hard to get help, could we say we need adequate customer support? How does implementing a live chatbot sound? Or customer support email?

Duke did mention that the Chinese told people the ambassador program is closed at the moment; clearly, he doesn't have enough information about SNET.

What happens in times when users try to join the Discord but get bounced back by the bot? Only someone who is patient will try multiple times.



Inputs from Lordkizzy:

Personally, I feel the basics here is that we don't have a straightforward onboarding process for members to get into the program, people come through different means and that is difficult to track and some come, so I would suggest fixing that first.

I would also love to see that the Onboarding Workgroup will become the first point of contact for new members and we use the last 10mins of our meetings to engage with new members, know their skills and help them locate the best workgroup based on their skills.

As regards to the survey, there were lots of comments for a one on one session, I also think we can implement that by assigning members to actual help newcomers into the program, I feel the work is too much for one person and I also noticed that the green leaf thingy that Peter and Vani talked about in one of our previous meetings can only be seen if you are using discord through a PC

Hello my name is Gorga Siagian, I would like to share my suggestions regarding this onboarding meeting. We recommend that in this onboarding meeting, there should be subtitles other than in English so that participants can understand what is being discussed, because each vocabulary issued by the person speaking is different so it can help if there are subtitles other than English. Then I made a suggestion that in our discord we should make a welcome bot, so that to welcome people who have just joined the SNET discord and we know it and can direct them to the ambassador program if they are interested.

Hi I am Daniel Oladepo. I believe in the Onboarding session there should be a document shared that includes details and steps of how new members can benefit in the community or contains information they should be aware of.

Hey I’m Onize, I want to suggest we foster and grow collaboration with other WGs and guilds. It will favor the ecosystem and new folks too. We can create a doc showing actionable points to this, and the main goal which is to help new folks in each WGs understand the SingularityNET ecosystem.



Hello, I am Kateri. I suggest that we should c onsider implementing a live chatbot for immediate assistance because it is not possible that someone can be active 24/7 to attend to new members.

Assign members specifically to help newcomers integrate into the community and understand the ecosystem. I believe that  they should be like 2 or 3 members with the role of welcoming newcomers always and that after each meeting they are to chat them up and help direct them properly.

Hi, i am Martinsoki.

Hi, I am Clement (boy_petrona). I guess I suggested earlier that the entirety of the documents and media we create during this process be merged into a single comprehensive documentation that would serve as a blueprint for the onboarding process. This can then be translated across multiple languages where necessary. I believe having this singular blueprint document would allow minor changes where necessary, rather than having to overhaul major individual documents and media which is sometimes resource intensive.
