## Commissioning video clips: what do you need to tell the video-maker?

If you have a video, and you want to commission someone (for example, the Ambassadorsâ€™ Video WG, although other videomakers are available! ðŸ™‚) to make some clips from it, you need to give them a clear brief. Hereâ€™s how.



**Specify the parts you want made into clips**

If you can, give start and end timestamps of the sections of your video that you want. If you want the editor to also edit out silences, speaker hesitations, or other empty content, or to correct audio clipping, bad colour balance, etc, you need to say this clearly. Check with your editor that they are able to make the corrections you want.

If you canâ€™t give timestamps, at least state the topics that you want to have clips of. Donâ€™t leave it to the editor to decide whatâ€™s important; remember, they do not know your content or message, and might not be able to form a qualitative understanding of it.



**Specify how long you want the clip(s) to be, and how many clips**

Donâ€™t be vague. Itâ€™s not helpful.



**Specify any text, subtitles, or other elements you want added**

Give the editor the text you want; donâ€™t expect them to write it themselves.

Share logos, files, etc in one clearly-labelled folder. Make sure your file names make sense.

Ask the editor in advance what quality they need for any elements youâ€™re adding (file formats, resolutions, etc) and check that your material conforms.



**Specify any colours, fonts, images and logos that you want used**

Within sNET, this is often decided for you - it will be sNET colours and fonts. But if you have any special requests, include them in the brief.



**Specify when you need it for**

Say clearly how flexible your dates are or arenâ€™t; factor in time for checking and corrections; and try not to give people rush jobs! Based on this, agree a date for a first draft.



**What to check**

When you get your edit(s), you should check

Is the clip the right length?

Is the audio a) loud enough b) clear?

Are any transitions smooth?

Has the editor removed things that you wanted removed (speaker hesitations; silences; etc)?

Are the right logos included?

Are there typos in any text thatâ€™s been used?



**Decide in advance what the corrections process will be**

Agree at your end who will sign it off or deal with corrections, and who else in your team needs to look at it.

Agree in advance who you should contact with corrections - will you DM the editor direct, (ideal) or send your request to the workgroup?

Make sure you have a clear record (e.g. in writing via DM) of what changes were requested, and when they will be done by.
