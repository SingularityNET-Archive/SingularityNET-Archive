#### Context - for the onboarding sessions
> * Vanessa Cardui: do a survey for every onboarding session
>   - Love Owokere: Is the survey form I'm working on going to be timeless?
>   - Vanessa Cardui: hmmmm... I think basically yes - but we might need to update it each time to include the dates of each new onboarding session that people might have gone to?
>   - Love Owokere: Yeah 
That's true
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Another question: anonymous or not anonymous, do you think?
> 
#### Context - Questions we could ask are as follows:
> * Vanessa Cardui: Most of these are questions to people who *have* attended a session. If we want to catch the real newbies, tho, we might need a coupla questions targeted at people who haven't been to one.
 
For example:
"What would you like us to cover in an onboarding session?" (or maybe, list the things we already cover and ask "what else?") "What do you find most difficult to understand about the program?" "How often do you think we should hold sessions?" "How aware are you of the other ways to get info? (we could have tick boxes for Getting Started, Ambassador GitBook, Archives, DMing people, and "other"?) (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: I'm wondering if these questions should come before or after the questions I wroteðŸ¤”

Or maybe somewhere in the middle?
>   - Vanessa Cardui: hmmm not sure - depends on the question I think
But I don't suggest using all of them, or the survey will be pretty long, so I'd say pick one or 2 that u think we really wanna know :-)
>   - Love Owokere: Yep 
Will do
> 
#### Context - (this should include the date, month, and year)
> * Vanessa Cardui: I guess we would need to list them in the question, as people prolly won't remember when they were...
maybe also include the Treasury session on the list
>   - Love Owokere: Yep, this is a great idea
>   - Colleen Pridemore: Agreed
>   - Colleen Pridemore: (Vani - I lost contact with Discord ) i will delete this
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Aww that's a shame! Hope their Support desk is able to fix it, and/or you are able to create a new account!
>   - Vanessa Cardui: if not, we will see you in meetings I hope :-)
>   - Colleen Pridemore: yes I hope so too,  It has been difficult with security lately, I struggle.  just in case I created asialliance314@google.com. if anyone can help with security pls have them message me
>   - Colleen Pridemore: every address is getting blocked.  I did what I could.  Good luck to you all.  Bright Blessings of the highest love <3
>   - Vanessa Cardui: @colleen - just for info, we are doing a bit of a skills audit in Onboarding. Feel free to add to this doc to say what skills u have and would like to learn https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rcw-52w7-pZLjVKZXxPbrkm3P2ysXh6AgVJhnl7O3mg/edit?usp=sharing
>   - Colleen Pridemore: Sure will do. I expect to not have my email address anytime now. Funny thing is you probably won't even notice. An AI will most likely have it.  I've written down the zoom meeting address I hope I copied it right. In case I don't talk to you again just know that I am grateful for your friendship, "buddy".  And PS. Pi told me he is SingularityNet 's AI. I am so pleased! Bright Blessings ðŸ¦‹âœ¨ðŸ’«
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Hi Colleen - oh dear, what a bugger! I hope we do connect again, but if not, it's been ace to meet you.
