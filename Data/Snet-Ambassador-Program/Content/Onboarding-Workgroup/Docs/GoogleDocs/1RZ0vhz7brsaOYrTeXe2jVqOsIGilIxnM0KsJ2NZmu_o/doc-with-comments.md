## Onboarding WG Survey Ideas



The first survey idea though brief is for the onboarding sessions that we do every quarter.

> Context - for the onboarding sessions
> * Vanessa Cardui: do a survey for every onboarding session
>   - Love Owokere: Is the survey form I'm working on going to be timeless?
>   - Vanessa Cardui: hmmmm... I think basically yes - but we might need to update it each time to include the dates of each new onboarding session that people might have gone to?
>   - Love Owokere: Yeah 
That's true
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Another question: anonymous or not anonymous, do you think?

### Questions we could ask are as follows:

> Context - Questions we could ask are as follows:
> * Vanessa Cardui: Most of these are questions to people who *have* attended a session. If we want to catch the real newbies, tho, we might need a coupla questions targeted at people who haven't been to one.
 
For example:
"What would you like us to cover in an onboarding session?" (or maybe, list the things we already cover and ask "what else?") "What do you find most difficult to understand about the program?" "How often do you think we should hold sessions?" "How aware are you of the other ways to get info? (we could have tick boxes for Getting Started, Ambassador GitBook, Archives, DMing people, and "other"?) (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: I'm wondering if these questions should come before or after the questions I wroteü§î

Or maybe somewhere in the middle?
>   - Vanessa Cardui: hmmm not sure - depends on the question I think
But I don't suggest using all of them, or the survey will be pretty long, so I'd say pick one or 2 that u think we really wanna know :-)
>   - Love Owokere: Yep 
Will do

### ‚úÖHave you been to any of our onboarding sessions before? If yes, which one? (this should include the date, month, and year)  

> [Comments]
> Context - (this should include the date, month, and year)
> * Vanessa Cardui: I guess we would need to list them in the question, as people prolly won't remember when they were...
maybe also include the Treasury session on the list
>   - Love Owokere: Yep, this is a great idea
>   - Colleen Pridemore: Agreed
>   - Colleen Pridemore: (Vani - I lost contact with Discord ) i will delete this
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Aww that's a shame! Hope their Support desk is able to fix it, and/or you are able to create a new account!
>   - Vanessa Cardui: if not, we will see you in meetings I hope :-)
>   - Colleen Pridemore: yes I hope so too,  It has been difficult with security lately, I struggle.  just in case I created asialliance314@google.com. if anyone can help with security pls have them message me
>   - Colleen Pridemore: every address is getting blocked.  I did what I could.  Good luck to you all.  Bright Blessings of the highest love <3
>   - Vanessa Cardui: @colleen - just for info, we are doing a bit of a skills audit in Onboarding. Feel free to add to this doc to say what skills u have and would like to learn https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rcw-52w7-pZLjVKZXxPbrkm3P2ysXh6AgVJhnl7O3mg/edit?usp=sharing
>   - Colleen Pridemore: Sure will do. I expect to not have my email address anytime now. Funny thing is you probably won't even notice. An AI will most likely have it.  I've written down the zoom meeting address I hope I copied it right. In case I don't talk to you again just know that I am grateful for your friendship, "buddy".  And PS. Pi told me he is SingularityNet 's AI. I am so pleased! Bright Blessings ü¶ã‚ú®üí´
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Hi Colleen - oh dear, what a bugger! I hope we do connect again, but if not, it's been ace to meet you.

### 04.23.2024 and a few others

### ‚úÖHow was the session for you? (options could be ‚ÄúWas it welcoming?‚Äù ‚ÄúWas it informative?‚Äù etc.) oh I felt very welcomed

### and I learned quite a bit about how SNet  would like to work, (Decentralization) and how collaboration is different from Decentralization. I also learned that some damn smart people initially organized SNet. I was very impressed with the Onboarding.



‚úÖ Did you find it helpful to your journey in the SNET Ambassador program? If yes, include a brief description. If not, please tell us why. I thought it was perfect for me, to have guidance but still be learning on my own. I think its the best solution for SNet integrating new people that want to get involved.



‚úÖIs there something you feel was missing in the session? Not that I can think of‚Ä¶



‚úÖWas it enough to make you feel ready to contribute to the growth of SingularityNET?

Oh yes, it gave me the jumping off point that I ne eded.



‚úÖIs the timing for our onboarding sessions okay for you? (yes, or no with reasons). Yes, I agree with once a week sessions



‚úÖHow often do you think we should hold sessions? Once a week



‚úÖWhat do you think we should do to improve our onboarding sessions for you and every new member out there? Nothing comes to mind right now



‚úÖWhat would you like us to cover in an onboarding session? Maybe having the simplest breakdown of the structure of SNet itself, sometimes that feels a bit muddy to me.  I.e. when you have X question, where can you go and if you have XX question, where can you go.  Maybe I‚Äôm not clear, let me know.



Also: If I wasn‚Äôt to actually FILL OUT this survey, let me know, I got confused between my role as Community Member and WorkGroup Member!







The second survey idea is for our weekly meetings

### Questions we could ask are as follows:
