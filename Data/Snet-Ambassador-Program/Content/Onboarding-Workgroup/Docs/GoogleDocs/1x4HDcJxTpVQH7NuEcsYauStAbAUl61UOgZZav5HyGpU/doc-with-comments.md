> * Vanessa Cardui: is this deffo correct? I thought it was more! :-)
>   - Clement Umoh: Oh. Great. Would definitely check this out
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Sucre will be able to tell us for sure :-)
>

As we did last Quarter, we have a roster for the facilitation and documentation of meetings, and we support new workgroup members who offer to give it a try.



### Collaborations

We have collaborated with Governance Guild this Quarter to create context-setting materials for the decisions that Core Contributors have been called upon to make. These included docs for the decision on Q1 budgets and on Q2 budgets; and we are also working on a doc to support the forthcoming decision on the name of the decision-making role in the Ambassador program. The idea here is that we wanted to address onboarding to the Core Contributor role, as well as onboarding to the Ambassador Program itself.

We had representatives from the SingularityNet LATAM community feature in our meeting, and offered them the opportunity to share success stories in relation to the onboarding activities within their community.  We also shared with them our

Gamers Guild used the Onboarding Workgroup as the first Workgroup they created in their Roblox game of the Ambassador Program. We collaborated with them to suggest characters and functionalities related to the Onboarding workgroup.

This quarter has also featured collaborative efforts between WG members on many of our tasks, leading to successful completion of initiatives.





**Events**

On 18th April. 2024, we held a session with André from Treasury Guild , open to all, which gave an overview of Cardano wallets, how payments are processed in the Ambassador Program, and an overview of the Treasury dashboard.

On 16th May, 2024, we held an Onboarding session for those new to the Ambassador program, consisting of a walkthrough video on how to navigate the Ambassador Discord channels, and a slide presentation on the Ambassador Program and how to get involved.

### Budgeting and r ewarding p rocesses

We engaged our members in quarterly budget planning and determining rewards for each task in and outside the WG. Several Onboarding members now attend Treasury Guild meetings on behalf of the group, fostering greater awareness and understanding of program-wide budget issues.

### Media

We created a video on how to navigate the Ambassador program’s Discord channels

Do we want to name / acknowledge the creators? e.g this was you, Clement, wasn't it?
>

We created a video, with voice-over, of our Onboarding slide deck



### Mentorship

We implemented a "Buddy"-style mentorship for new members in the WG, where new members are paired with existing members for the purposes of mentorship and guidance. We asked both mentors and mentees for feedback on how it went - see report here

We initiated a skill sharing/ peer support process where more experienced WG members can support less experienced members to do project-based tasks. This will be further developed in Q3.

### Facilitation s upport

We introduced members to The Facilitators' Collective (a Cardano Project Catalyst project) which has a self-paced online training course for facilitators. This was useful in the refinement of meeting facilitation skills among new and existing members.

### Onboarding Session r esearch

We conducted a survey to assess the community’s feelings about our quarterly Onboarding sessions for new people. You can read the report here, and see what changes we propose to make as a result of the data.

### One-to-one e ngagement

We continued offering direct one-to-one support to new people joining the program via DM.

We continue to email potential new entrants to the Ambassador program, and open a channel of communication with them. ****

# Comments from WG Members🌟

It's been a “ **learning while doing”** quarter for me and I enjoyed it! We are more organized, thoughtful, and efficient thanks to WG members so I look forward to greater heights.

This has been such an eventful quarter for me, made my first meeting facilitation ever in the program, also became a core contributor. The onboarding wg is filled with amazing people. - Ayo

This quarter has been amazing! I've been having fun from the beginning to the end. I learned a lot, from writing the onboarding journey document to creating the graphics to promote the content. Still, a lot of people are looking forward to watching the video footage. Secondly, I thought the skills document was a creative idea; well done, Vani, Sucre, and Love. Several WGs and Guild members have recognized the importance of this doc and are eager to see individuals acquire the skills about which they are most passionate about – **Cjfrankie**

It’s awesome to see how much this WG has grown and I look forward to us achieving greater things.

It's always nice to be in the Onboarding Workgroup sessions, that's one of the many sessions that makes you feel relaxed and free to communicate, the main thing for me this quarter was the buddy system, in that I didn't just get the opportunity to onboard a new person in the program but rather I got to make a friend. Thanks to everyone who has been actively contributing to the Workgroup. **Lordkizzy**

The workgroup that I found myself was the Onboarding WG, the sessions are always filled with love and I am glad to be a part of it. I want to specially thank every member. **KATERI**



# Our plans for Q3 2024 include:

A refined and more direct 1-2-1 onboarding process, where new people in Discord are guided through basic onboarding as soon as they arrive, invited to ask any questions they might have, and then asked about their skills and signposted to Guilds and Workgroups that are currently doing work that they might find interesting.

> * Gorga Siagian: Instead of the onboarders role to be initiated, why is there another 1-2-1 session, is this function different from "onboarders"?
>

Skillsharing/peer education sessions on key skills that people need in order to onboard effectively into the ecosystem

Q&A sessions for newcomers with all the Guild and WG leads, so people can find out more about what is happening in the different groups.
