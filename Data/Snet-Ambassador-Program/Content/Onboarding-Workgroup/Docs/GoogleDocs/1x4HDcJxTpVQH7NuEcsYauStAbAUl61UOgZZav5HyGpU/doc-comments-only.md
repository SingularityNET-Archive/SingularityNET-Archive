#### Context - A refined and more direct 1-2-1 onboarding process, where new people in Discord are guided through basic onboarding as soon as they arrive, invited to ask any questions they might have, and then asked about their skills and signposted to Guilds and Workgroups that are currently doing work that they might find interesting.
> * Gorga Siagian: Instead of the onboarders role to be initiated, why is there another 1-2-1 session, is this function different from "onboarders"?
> 
#### Context - Out of a Q2 budget of $6,305, we spent $X00 . (Reason for outcome to be accounted for after complete assessment of financial statistics from the Treasury)
> * Tevo Saks: what is meant by complete assessment?
Isnt this report to be that assessment? 

Also you will not find USD answers.
The budget request was converted to AGIX and is spent with AGIX.

If by assessments you meant reviewing fund requests then we update the final assessment every Tuesday.
And the Onboarding WG financial statistics can be seen here: https://treasuryguild.com/Singularity%20Net/Singularity%20Net%20Ambassador%20Wallet?tab=report&months=05.2024%2C04.2024%2C06.2024&workgroups=onboarding-workgroup&tokens=AGIX%2CMinutes&labels=All+labels

> * Ayo OLU-AYOOLA7D: Not sure if this is necessary or if it falls under the purview of the OWG... but the SNET discord channel has a total member number, may be we can begin to track quarterly growth and see what fraction of those numbers (new entrants) eventually considers becoming an Ambassador.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Could do - but not for this Quarter's report :-)

Maybe you could raise this in the next WG meeting?
(oh and BTW there's no such role as "Ambassador" :-)
>   - Ayo OLU-AYOOLA7D: Yeah, thanks.
Not as a role though but as a member of the program, anyways I get the drift.

Definitely not this quarter report.

I will bring it up at next meeting
>   - Vanessa Cardui: cool :-)
Yeh I guess all I'm saying with the "there are no ambassadors" thing is, we'd need to decide what to track. "Number of new entrants who go on to become core contributors" could be a thing - but as it takes a bit of time to become a core contributor, there would be a time lag. Not a problem, but just worth noting. 
Plus it's important to note that the Discord server is for *the whole of sNET* - so it's all the spinoffs, Deepfunding, etc etc. So it might not be all that valid to track how many entrants to the server become core contributors in the Ambassador program, since that might not be what they all came here to do. :-)

I'll get on it soon
> 
#### Context - Continuous Onboarding Research
> * Vanessa Cardui: I could be wrong but I think all this was completed last Quarter, so it shouldn't be in here? Conducting the survey intself definitely shouldn't   - it was in Q4 2023 :-) (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Love Owokere: The first bullet point is not supposed to be there, true but the second one is at the right place.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: 👍 OK taking the first one out :-)
> 
#### Context - video on how to navigate the Ambassador program’s Discord channels
> * Vanessa Cardui: find link
Do we want to name / acknowledge the creators? e.g this was you, Clement, wasn't it?
> 
#### Context - link.
> * Vanessa Cardui: use YouTube link instead (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
> 
#### Context - slide presentation on the Ambassador Program

>   - Vanessa Cardui: Sucre will be able to tell us for sure :-)
> 
#### Context - regular meetings once a week
> * Vanessa Cardui: It's handy to include a link to Archive documentation of one of our meetings from this quarter. I'll find one and add it (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Clement Umoh: Ok. I will do this. Thanks
>   - Vanessa Cardui: fab
