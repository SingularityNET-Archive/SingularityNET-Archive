**Mine‚Äôs üë©‚Äçü¶∞ Journey:**

**Knows a lot about AI** : So, we have Mine. She resides in a small city in the Philippines where English is not widely spoken and there's a poor internet facility there. With a computer science major who has delved into the realm of AI. Her quest for AI is optimum, but she uses a small Android device which potentially limits her social engagement. Her mom has a PC, however, Mine only has access to the PC on weekends. One fateful day, she took to YouTube to watch some AI-related videos on her mom‚Äôs PC- boom, she stumbled upon ‚Äú **Grace the Robot''** , a humanoid robot designed as an assistant for doctors. She began to hop from webpage to webpage trying to find out more about Grace. Then she came across an interesting Mindplex podcast episode featuring Grace and some iconic characters. Immediately, she followed SNET on YouTube and also joined the Ambassadors‚Äô Discord server.



**First language isn‚Äôt English:** Language barrier is one sure-fire factor that can affect someone‚Äôs onboarding journey - Mine‚Äôs native language is Tagalog. After Mine joined the Ambassadors‚Äô Discord, she introduced herself in the introduction channel, and explored some of the WGs, and to her greatest surprise, it‚Äôs a program that incentivizes people to share their skill(s). She was very interested in the writers‚Äô workgroup because she has written some Tagalog blogs, so she isn‚Äôt new to writing. Unfortunately for her, she knew that contributing to the program would be a far-fetched idea because she couldn‚Äôt communicate fluently in English and she had no good PC to stay connected. Mine has added multiple meetings to her calendar, but couldn‚Äôt attend due to the difference in time zone; one fateful day, she finally joined a session, but couldn‚Äôt join the conversation.



**Can‚Äôt differentiate between deep funding and the ambassador program:** Mine was able to join the Ambassadors‚Äô town hall meeting. Luckily, she met her country friend  there, and she felt she had found solutions to her plight; someone who would tell her more about the Ambassador program and possibly interpret some discussions in their local language. Her country friend is a member of the R&D guild but he barely attends meetings. Fast forward 6 months, and Mine is still unable to contribute to the program. She was trying to get along with the program, but the SNET discord server is very wide. She saw many things that seemed unclear to her; from workgroups to guilds to deep funding, all were a bit confusing! She thought that the Ambassador program and deep funding were  separate groups that may need different skills. Mine shared her difficulties in the general Discord chat and thankfully, she got a message from one of the core contributors,  who helped her through the process; plus, she also shared insights into how tasks and contributions are done in the program. **The Archive WG is another WG that caught her eye. Sometimes,Mine would go to the Archives to translate some of the WG meeting notes just so she could get a glimpse of what the discussion was about.**



**Vito‚Äôs üßî‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Journey**

**Doesn‚Äôt know about AI** : We also have Vito. He is a full-time real estate developer who hails from Argentina. He doesn‚Äôt have any prior knowledge about AI, but he loves the conversations around AI. As a real estate developer, he‚Äôs seeking tools that will make his work easier! During his research, he came across a fascinating Twitter thread (on the Ambassadors‚Äô Twitter account) that talks about the transformative impact of AI in the real estate industry. Having read through a few short lines, he was amazed to know the potential of AI in his field of work; he followed the SNET‚Äôs Ambassador Twitter account hoping to read more interesting articles in the future. He began to explore some of the content on the Twitter page, and he knew there was something spectacular about SingularityNET. His quest for AI increased ever since.



**Being new to the decentralized way of doing things in the Ambassador program:** Vito just had his web3 debut. He has no clue what a crypto wallet is, decentralization is completely foreign to him. He also didn‚Äôt have any friends in the crypto space. Whenever anything seemed unclear to him, he‚Äôd always run to a Core Contributor who happened to be in charge of the Onboarding WG.  Vito knew within himself that contributing to the program was a far-fetched idea. He's also a very shy person who hates the sight of crowds and public speaking. So he started following crypto threads whilst attending Twitter spaces.



**First language isn‚Äôt English:** Although Vito‚Äôs native language is Spanish, his English speaking skills are impeccable. It was 5 months since Vito last visited his Twitter account due to his full-time job; it was Christmas season already, his company had gone on vacation, and while he was at home, he remembered the SNET Ambassador Twitter account which he followed a little while ago, and began to scroll through some interesting posts. This time around it wasn‚Äôt real estate-related! At that moment, AI piqued his interest. After reading a post, again, he decided to join the Ambassadors‚Äô Discord server so he could connect with like-minded people and learn more about AI. Then, he went straight ahead to the R&D guild channel to see what their conversation was like, because he‚Äôs a real estate developer. Now, Vito feels like he‚Äôs finally where he belongs. Time zone wasn‚Äôt his concern, only that the nature of his work is a bit overwhelming, and probably he won‚Äôt have time to contribute - So sad! Vito decided to explore more channels in the Discord server and he bumped into the ‚Äú **Translation Channel** .‚Äù He went over some of the completed translation tasks and at once he smiled. Since Spanish is his native language, he decided to contribute as a Spanish translator; on the other hand, Vito got even more excited because he was going to meet other Spanish speakers as he contributed along the way. He dropped a message saying he was interested, then he got a message from Translation WG‚Äôs lead. An interview was scheduled, and he nailed it.



**Dismad‚Äôs üßî‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Journey**

**Knows a lot about AI** : Dismad is a crypto enthusiast and a medical student who has deep knowledge of AI. He also participates in various crypto airdrops and does crypto arbitrage; he also loves to read about crypto-based projects - he has sophisticated computer and mobile devices for his trading views. He also holds multiple cryptos including **AGIX tokens** which he bought some time ago. He knows so much about ambassador programs, he's even an ambassador somewhere. One day, he logged into his Binance account to buy tokens as usual, and stumbled upon AGIX tokens, and he recalled that he had had some AGIX. He decided to read more about AGIX and the community that is building it, then he went to YouTube to watch a couple of videos. One YouTuber talked about SingularityNET, so he visited the SNET‚Äôs website. To his greatest surprise, he discovered they run an ambassador program. He followed SNET on Twitter and he joined Discord shortly after. **Happy Dismad found himself in a whole new world, the SNET‚Äôs Ambassador program was a bit different from others.**



**Having lots of skills that you are confident to use:**  Dismad is not only a crypto enthusiast, he is also an ardent educationalist and he‚Äôs proficient with DAO tooling. Having joined the SingularityNET Ambassadors‚Äô Discord server, Dismad was trying to catch a glimpse of the future with SNET‚Äôs Ambassador program because everything seemed different to him. He went to the introduction channel to introduce himself, while also citing his strengths and weaknesses, and he also stated that he has experience working with DAO tooling and readables. He felt that having lots of education experience and working with DAO tools would help his journey. One of the Core Contributors welcomed him and told him to send a chat to the Education guild and Governance workgroup leads. He sent the messages respectively, and soon, he got a reply from the Governance WG lead telling him how SingularityNET‚Äôs program works and how the community is building AI/AGI for a beneficial ecosystem. The Education guild WG lead also replied to his chat explaining how the Education guild operates and makes valuable content for a wide range of individuals across different backgrounds. After Dismad read this heartfelt message, Dismad went missing in action, he never got any feedback regarding the test. Now, Dismad was preparing for his second year exams and he could barely keep in touch anymore. 4 months later, Dismad came back and explained his plight to both workgroup leads; they both wished him success in his exams.



**Being required to attend a lot of regular meetings** : At the core of being a student is constant learning. Dismad had already been onboarded into the Education Guild, he even pitched an idea to make educational content that would target the SNET Ambassadors program‚Äôs Filipino fan base through videos. He‚Äôs also in close contact with the Governance WG lead. As a medical student, he barely has enough time for things aside from school! The Ambassador program requires that you are regular at meetings. It's been 6 months since he joined the program but he hasn't been able to contribute because most workgroups assign tasks during their meetings and the meetings don't fit his schedule as a medical student. This is a hindrance to Dismad.
