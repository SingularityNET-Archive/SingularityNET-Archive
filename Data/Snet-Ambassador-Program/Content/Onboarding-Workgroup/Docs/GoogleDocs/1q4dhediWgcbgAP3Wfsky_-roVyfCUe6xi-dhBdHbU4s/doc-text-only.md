# Onboarding the Ambassador Program

<:SNETLogo:912292628731670588> Welcome to the SingularityNET Ambassador Program



The SingularityNET Ambassador Program is dedicated to growing awareness of the importance of decentralized AI/AGI and the SingularityNET ecosystem. Through the program, we aim to provide structure and rewards to community members who are committed to contributing towards a beneficial AGI. For background information on the SingularityNET Ecosystem, see https://singularitynet.io/ecosystem



Our main drivers are transparency, decentralization, and involvement. To uphold these values, community members are fully involved in decision-making processes, including how tokens are spent. This is achieved through regular Ambassador Town Hall meetings, which are open to all members of the community.

**Step 4: Sign Up on Dework and complete the Introduction task**

Head over to Dework and sign up (here’s a video on how to sign up and use Dework), and complete the introduction task . Remember to submit your Cardano native wallet address through the form embedded in the task - this is used for distributing rewards for completed tasks. Please be aware that this links your wallet address with your Discord name in a relatively public way. To protect your privacy, you might want to create a new wallet, which only has Ambassador Program transactions in it, and submit that. If you need help on how to create a wallet, please see here https://instance-dework-pbl.vercel.app/course/module/101/1015



**Step 5: Get involved with Workgroups and Guilds**

Participating and contributing in Workgroups and Guilds is how you work towards becoming an Ambassador. You can be part of as many workgroups/guilds as you want. To become part of a workgroup, simply start attending its meetings (see our calendar here https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=singularitynetambassadors%40gmail.com&ctz=UTC ). You can also go to the group’s Discord channel and join the conversation; and you can take on Dework tasks that the group posts. And remember, you can provide anonymous feedback about the groups and about the program in general, using this form https://forms.gle/Lvkafk7ZB8xzcgQq7

### FAQ

Q: **How do I become an Ambassador?**

A: Getting involved with WorkGroups and Guilds is how you work towards becoming an Ambassador.



Q:  **What kinds of tasks can I get involved with?**

A: You can find various tasks on Dework - they include things like making videos, facilitation, documenting etc. You can also start a new workgroup if you have ideas for how to improve the Ambassador Program.



Q: **How can I find a task?**

A: It varies from workgroup to workgroup. Most of the time tasks are assigned in the meeting or through discussions in the Discord channels. To learn about how to apply for Dework tasks, see the video https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YgdsBKEkCV3VGhCtT7hpD5o-PeJI6Rhm/view?usp=drive_link  Some Workgroups provide bounties that you can apply for on Dework.



Q: **How long does it take to become an Ambassador?**

A: There is an expectation that new members engage in workgroups for several months before being considered for the ambassador role



Q: **What wallet to use?**

A: It is advisable to use Cardano native wallets like Eternl, Nami, Typhon wallets, etc rather  than using the likes of Trust wallet or Metamask. Also, with a wallet like Eternl, users can create an address book of recipients and up to 24 accounts from the exact mnemonic phrase. If you need help with how to create a wallet, see our guide here



Q: **How do I get rewarded?**

Once you submit a completed task, it will be reviewed and audited before being paid out in AGIX. You will be rewarded for completing tasks each week on Tuesdays.

Kindly submit a Cardano wallet address by filling this form: https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA  if you haven't done so already.



Q: **What are Gimbals?**

A: A Gimbal (GMBL) is a token, originally created by Gimbalabs ( https://www.gimbalabs.com ) in the Catalyst ecosystem.

Although it can be traded on DEXs like any other token, it has no direct fiat value. Instead, it is used to track participation and engagement. Tasks such as meeting attendance can be rewarded with Gimbals; then the number of Gimbals that someone holds can be a measure of how much they have engaged.



In SNET, each taskpoint in Dework is worth 100 GMBL. See our Dework PBL (Project-Based Learning) for more info on how we use GMBL to track participation:

https://andamio-andamiojs-starter-lms-git-governance-g-1b84f0-gimbalabs.vercel.app/course/module/201/2018



Q: **What are MINS?**

The MINS tokens are created by Singularity Net Treasury Guild to track the minutes allocated to each task on dework and capturing the minutes on chain by sending these MINS tokens out with every reward distribution.
