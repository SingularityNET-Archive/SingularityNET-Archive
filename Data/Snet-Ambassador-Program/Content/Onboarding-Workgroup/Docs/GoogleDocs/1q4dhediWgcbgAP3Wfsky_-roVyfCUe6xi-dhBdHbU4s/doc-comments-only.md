#### Context - rewards for completed tasks.
> * Vanessa Cardui: Based on convo in Treasury meeting today, I think we should add:

"Please be aware that this links your wallet address with your Discord name in a relatively public way. To protect your privacy, you might want to create a new wallet, which only has Ambassador Program transactions in it, and submit that. If you need help on how to create a wallet, please see here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t4kGaNOLLkI-xwJyg32s_OrR4ojV3ODI1xmiUbxaQG0/edit?usp=sharing"

I'd also suggest adding something like this to the Treasury Guild Wallet Collector form itself https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA - I guess we'd need to ask Miro or André? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)

#### Context - FAQ
> * Sophia Kaine: "How do I get rewarded?
Once you submit a completed task, it will be reviewed and audited before being paid out in AGIX.
You will be rewarded for completed tasks each week on Tuesdays. 
Kindly submit a Cardano wallet address by filling this form: https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA if you haven't done so already. (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)

#### Context - FAQ
> * Vanessa Cardui: Add "What are Gmbls"? Vani to write

Add "how do I get rewarded?" Sucre to write

Add "What wallets can we use?" Onyeka to write (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Nwobi Onyeka: What wallet to use?
It is advisable to use a cardano wallets like: Eternl wallet, Typhon Wallet than using the likes of trust wallet and metamask, due to the fact that unlike other wallets that store private keys online, Cardano hardware wallets keep private keys offline, ensuring they remain secure and under the user's control and also with Eternl wallet, users can create an address book of recipients and up to 24 accounts from the exact mnemonic phrase. Eternl wallet is also used for staking to a pool and registering to vote in Project Catalyst.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Q: What are Gimbals?
A: A Gimbal (GMBL) is a token, originally created by Gimbalabs (  https://www.gimbalabs.com) in the Catalyst ecosystem.

Although it can be traded on DEXs like any other token, it has no direct fiat value. Instead, it is used to track participation and engagement. Tasks such as meeting attendance can be rewarded with Gimbals; then the number of Gimbals that someone holds can be a measure of how much they have engaged.

In sNET, each taskpoint in Dework is worth 100 GMBL. See our Dework PBL (project-based learning) for more info on how we use GMBL to track participation:

#### Context - Introduction task
> * Vanessa Cardui: we decided to tweak this task - ask people to post their intro in #Introductions, then post a link in Dework to show they have done it.
(Give link to new #Introductions channel)
Reward 50 Gimbals
Say in the Dework task that this is the reward (Resolved by Sophia Kaine)
>   - Sophia Kaine: rewards: 10 AGIX, 50 GMBLS
>   - Vanessa Cardui: The Introductory task doesn't seem to have been changed yet to reflect the above decison? https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas/team-tasks-25?taskId=188e1e95-97ea-4c85-be1c-c8323a4e442b
>   - Tevo Saks: Created a link for the Introduction Template Task: https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas/team-tasks-25/settings/templates?taskId=046a1abf-b0db-41ae-8e6c-bc4e4e5838eb

Better if template is used instead of direct task.

Also we use MINS tokens now and assigning task points is enough to automatically do that 0.5 task points = 30MINS tokens
> 
#### Context - introduction task
> * Vanessa Cardui: (from Mihai)
After finding the task, the first impression is that it is a bit confusing. There doesn't seem to be a task for a specific person, but rather a task for everyone. And the task is to comment in that task with a short introduction about the applicant, which makes it seem that it is not really a task but a duplication of the already written introduction in the initial Google form used to apply to the program.

Maybe the confusions described in 2 and 3 above are what lead to the last comment in the initial task to be from 2 months ago? Is this really the case? (no new applications for the Ambassador Program in last 2 months)

As a possible solution, maybe the Onboarding Workgroup might consider creating a Dework task for each new applicant once they receive the initial Google Form. But that's naturally open to debate as part of that specific circle, which is too particular now for this general chat. (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
