# Onboarding the Ambassador Program

<:SNETLogo:912292628731670588> Welcome to the SingularityNET Ambassador Program



The SingularityNET Ambassador Program is dedicated to growing awareness of the importance of decentralized AI/AGI and the SingularityNET ecosystem. Through the program, we aim to provide structure and rewards to community members who are committed to contributing towards a beneficial AGI. For background information on the SingularityNET Ecosystem, see https://singularitynet.io/ecosystem



Our main drivers are transparency, decentralization, and involvement. To uphold these values, community members are fully involved in decision-making processes, including how tokens are spent. This is achieved through regular Ambassador Town Hall meetings, which are open to all members of the community.

### Here's a step-by-step guide to help you kickstart your journey into the Ambassador Program.



**Step 1: Join Our Discord Server**

> Context - Join Our Discord Server
> * Vanessa Cardui: We need to add something about Sucre's role in welcoming people - can lift it from Ambassador GitBook, I think it's in there

If you haven't already, join our Discord server.



**Step 2: Fill in this form to express your interest in becoming an Ambassador:**  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3EKjCONzpnrgm7g2latLg_eFpfRjYRoAEr7TzPrx5HfEsPw/viewform  

> [Comments]
> Context - Fill in this form
> * Vanessa Cardui: (From Mihai, via Ambassador Gneral channel):
At Step 1 of the getting started guide, the Google form should have a better cover photo. Maybe the one used on the Ambassadors Program Twitter, YouTube would give this form a nicer look. (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)

**Step 3: Attend Ambassadors' Town Hall Meetings**

Join us every Tuesday at 18:00 UTC on Zoom, for the main weekly get-together for anyone interested in the Ambassador program. Here, you can get the latest program updates and connect with Ambassadors. If you only attend one meeting in the week, make it this one!  The link is in our Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=singularitynetambassadors%40gmail.com

You can add Calendar to your Google Account from Bottom right corner



**Step 4: Sign Up on Dework and complete the Introduction task**

> [Comments]
> Context - Introduction task
> * Vanessa Cardui: we decided to tweak this task - ask people to post their intro in #Introductions, then post a link in Dework to show they have done it.
(Give link to new #Introductions channel)
Reward 50 Gimbals
Say in the Dework task that this is the reward (Resolved by Sophia Kaine)
>   - Sophia Kaine: rewards: 10 AGIX, 50 GMBLS
>   - Vanessa Cardui: The Introductory task doesn't seem to have been changed yet to reflect the above decison? https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas/team-tasks-25?taskId=188e1e95-97ea-4c85-be1c-c8323a4e442b
>   - Tevo Saks: Created a link for the Introduction Template Task: https://app.dework.xyz/singularitynet-ambas/team-tasks-25/settings/templates?taskId=046a1abf-b0db-41ae-8e6c-bc4e4e5838eb

Better if template is used instead of direct task.

Also we use MINS tokens now and assigning task points is enough to automatically do that 0.5 task points = 30MINS tokens

> * Vanessa Cardui: (from Mihai)

At Step 3 of the getting started guide, I must say that I had a bit of trouble finding the Introduction Task. First watched the linked video from Step 3, in hopes that it might include a mention of this task. Which it doesn't. Maybe it should be linked from the getting started guide here on Discord.

Head over to Dework and sign up (here’s a video on how to sign up and use Dework), and complete the introduction task . Remember to submit your Cardano native wallet address through the form embedded in the task - this is used for distributing rewards for completed tasks. Please be aware that this links your wallet address with your Discord name in a relatively public way. To protect your privacy, you might want to create a new wallet, which only has Ambassador Program transactions in it, and submit that. If you need help on how to create a wallet, please see here https://instance-dework-pbl.vercel.app/course/module/101/1015

> * Vanessa Cardui: Based on convo in Treasury meeting today, I think we should add:

"Please be aware that this links your wallet address with your Discord name in a relatively public way.

If you need help on how to create a wallet, please see here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t4kGaNOLLkI-xwJyg32s_OrR4ojV3ODI1xmiUbxaQG0/edit?usp=sharing"

I'd also suggest adding something like this to the Treasury Guild Wallet Collector form itself https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA - I guess we'd need to ask Miro or André? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Tevo Saks: Replaced google Doc with this link: https://instance-dework-pbl.vercel.app/course/module/101/1015

And updated Getting started channel

> * Vanessa Cardui: (from Mihai)
After finding the task, the first impression is that it is a bit confusing. There doesn't seem to be a task for a specific person, but rather a task for everyone. And the task is to comment in that task with a short introduction about the applicant, which makes it seem that it is not really a task but a duplication of the already written introduction in the initial Google form used to apply to the program.

Maybe the confusions described in 2 and 3 above are what lead to the last comment in the initial task to be from 2 months ago? Is this really the case? (no new applications for the Ambassador Program in last 2 months)

As a possible solution, maybe the Onboarding Workgroup might consider creating a Dework task for each new applicant once they receive the initial Google Form. But that's naturally open to debate as part of that specific circle, which is too particular now for this general chat. (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)

**Step 5: Get involved with Workgroups and Guilds**

> Context - Get involved

Participating and contributing in Workgroups and Guilds is how you work towards becoming an Ambassador. You can be part of as many workgroups/guilds as you want. To become part of a workgroup, simply start attending its meetings (see our calendar here https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=singularitynetambassadors%40gmail.com&ctz=UTC ). You can also go to the group’s Discord channel and join the conversation; and you can take on Dework tasks that the group posts. And remember, you can provide anonymous feedback about the groups and about the program in general, using this form https://forms.gle/Lvkafk7ZB8xzcgQq7

> * Nwobi Onyeka: Q: What's the MINS token?

The MINS tokens are created by Singularity Net Treasury Guild to track the minutes allocated to each task on dework and capturing the minutes on chain by sending these MINS tokens out with every reward distribution. (Resolved by Tevo Saks)

Add "how do I get rewarded?" Sucre to write

Add "What wallets can we use?" Onyeka to write (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Nwobi Onyeka: What wallet to use?
It is advisable to use a cardano wallets like: Eternl wallet, Typhon Wallet than using the likes of trust wallet and metamask, due to the fact that unlike other wallets that store private keys online, Cardano hardware wallets keep private keys offline, ensuring they remain secure and under the user's control and also with Eternl wallet, users can create an address book of recipients and up to 24 accounts from the exact mnemonic phrase. Eternl wallet is also used for staking to a pool and registering to vote in Project Catalyst.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Q: What are Gimbals?
A: A Gimbal (GMBL) is a token, originally created by Gimbalabs (  https://www.gimbalabs.com) in the Catalyst ecosystem.

Although it can be traded on DEXs like any other token, it has no direct fiat value. Instead, it is used to track participation and engagement. Tasks such as meeting attendance can be rewarded with Gimbals; then the number of Gimbals that someone holds can be a measure of how much they have engaged.

In sNET, each taskpoint in Dework is worth 100 GMBL. See our Dework PBL (project-based learning) for more info on how we use GMBL to track participation:
