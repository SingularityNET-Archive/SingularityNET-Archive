#### Context - we could ask each WG to assign a bit of meeting time to discuss onboarding and how they do it - one of us would go along and explain our learnings from the Onboarding retrospective (i.e. that the message of decentralisation needs to be backed up in the program as a whole); then we find out what they each do to onboard new people who show up, what the issues are from their perspective,, and then we create a text resource with everyone’s ideas. (We’d also add our own ideas for what works)
> * Nwobi Onyeka: I suggest that each work group, should have someone aside the head of the group (a senior member) that's will help to communicate with new members (by answering questions) due to the fact that most heads of each work group are always busy and don't always reply on time
>   - Vanessa Cardui: nice idea - agree (altho ofc with flexibility, e.g. a very small and new WG might not have the capacity; or some WGs might prefer to do it more collectively between them all)
