1) thank those who took part
2) acknowledge that it can be difficult, and onboarding takes time and effort (and should be budgeted for)
3) acknowleding that sometimes there can be worries about new people coming in and how it will work, and that this is understandable but it's something WGs need to overcome
3) give some stronger recommendations - reiterate that it's important, and how we onboard in WGs has big reprecussions; and that WGs should give thought to how they onboard new people (altho obvs, they each do it in their own way). (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)

#### Context - Why is it important for Guilds and WorkGroups?
> * Vanessa Cardui: I feel like maybe we should make this a bit stronger, and make it more of a recommendation based on our research?

We all know that there are practices here and there within the program that can make people feel excluded or not welcomed. So while I'm not suggesting we name names or anything (!), I wonder if we need some generic "Don't"s? And I do think we should be a bit stronger in recomending good practice, and saying that WGs *should* give consistent attention to onboarding. (And then maybe link to Lady Tempestt's resource with ideas for how to do it.) (Resolved by Nwobi Onyeka)
>   - Nwobi Onyeka: That's a nice idea, we could discuss that in the meeting on the "Don't"s

#### Context - quarterly onboarding session
> * Vanessa Cardui: Are you saying here that this session should have more detail about the different WGs - maybe even people from each WG coming to say what they do? (which would be quite a cool idea, tho perhaps a bit fiddly to organise... hmmm maybe WG leads could send a 60-second video or something...)

Or do you mean pretty much like the onboarding sessions we do now? (Resolved by Nwobi Onyeka)
>   - Nwobi Onyeka: I feel we could talk to the new members or members yet to feel onboarded in a One on one conversation and get their challenges, experiences so far in the program, then set them on the right track to what they need to feel part of the process

Could you pull this point out a bit more in your conclusion in blue - like, workgroups need to think about their capacity, and grow organically? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Nwobi Onyeka: Totally, I can do that

#### Context - If there is anything our previous onboarding survey has shown us, it actually shows that most people actually feel onboarded after been given a task but i don&#39;t think the task should be a criteria to join the guild or workgroup
> * Vanessa Cardui: I think this is a really good and interesting point.
Generally we tend to think that (apart from Video, Writers and Translation), you don't need to do a task to become a member. But what our research shows is that in practice, you kinda do... 
I mean that, according to what people are saying here, doing work is key;  if you kept showing up to the meetings of a group, but never took on any work, you probably wouldn't feel very onboarded - and the other members of the group probably wouldn't see you as fully part of the group either.

Nice one for pulling that insight out of it! (Resolved by Nwobi Onyeka)
>   - Nwobi Onyeka: Thanks

#### Context - Fair enough to me from all workgroups
> * Vanessa Cardui: True :-)
But maybe this could be more like a conclusion/summary - something like "most groups do share some orienting info with new people; it's mostly done in a meeting itself or in Discord" or whatever
> 
#### Context - Is there any info you share with them?
> * Vanessa Cardui: I wonder if we should include the actual links to the things people have mentioned? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Nwobi Onyeka: please links exactly?
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Ouff, you'd have to track them down :-)  That's part of the task of writing a report like this!
Maybe we can make it a group task - everyone to add any they can find.
> 
#### Context - It&#39;s nice to see a little time allocated in meetings for new members if any are available
> * Vanessa Cardui: This kinda feels like the same conclusion as the one immediately above. I wonder if these 2 sections should be smooshed together? (Resolved by Nwobi Onyeka)
>   - Nwobi Onyeka: Same here too
> 
#### Context - i feel that
> * Vanessa Cardui: Your personal comments and conclusions are great - 

but I'm thinking, if the whole Onboarding group agrees with them (and I'm guesing they will) maybe we could change it to "we"? so it's from all of us as a group? (Resolved by Nwobi Onyeka)
