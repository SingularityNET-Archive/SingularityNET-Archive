# Report on Continuous Onboarding sessions with Guilds and WorkGroups,  December 2023





# Introduction

Our Continuous Onboarding sessions started with a brief description of continuous onboarding: ‚Äú **Onboarding is not just the moment when you fill in a form or attend your first meeting; it's a process and it takes a while** ‚Äù.



****

# Why is continuous onboarding important for Guilds and WorkGroups?

****

Our research shows that continuous onboarding mostly happens in Guilds and WorkGroups. So it is important that when a new person attends a meeting for the first time, you support that ongoing onboarding process, in a way that suits your group. We recommend that Workgroups should encourage input from new members, both in their meetings or in Discord, thereby showing the decentralized nature of the Ambassador program.





# Current status of Onboarding in your WorkGroups



## Q1. How are new people welcomed/introduced?

****

**Onboarding Workgroup**

Just say Hi üòÑ  Giving people tasks early on is a good way to welcome them.



**Video Workgroup**

We have a ‚ÄúJoin the Video Workgroup‚Äù task on Dework



**Marketing Guild**

Give them a short overview over the WG/Guild (purpose, current topics, workflow etc.)



**Gamers‚Äô Guild**

People are free to socialize - Gamers session is an icebreaker



**Writers Workgroup**

We give a short introduction on the workgroup. This includes how to join, how we collaborate and what we do.



**Translations Workgroup**

By saying hi, welcome to the WG



**Governance Workgroup**

No formal process, open meetings, mainly discussions, people come if they want to, It's very informal - be kind, be welcoming, let people speak and make sure they know they are welcome. Similar to Treasury and Archives - title isn't interesting to everyone? so it feels abstract, and it's maybe offputting cos you need lots of background understanding.



**Archives Workgroup**

By saying hi if they just turn up; tho if they approach us beforehand, we will share the GitHub board, videos, etc. Sometimes we need to invite someone specific to collaborate, and will then have a call with them.



**Knowledge Base Workgroup**

In meetings: we start meetings with asking if new people have any questions re what the WG is about, In both situations the actual welcoming happens in the meeting. Mainly I onboard people through different meetings based on the current topics. I usually give them a simple zoom link, or if they are Discord people then guide them to the Discord channel. We are now experimenting with onboarding people through Dework too. We allocate ~10 minutes as an opportunity for people to ask clarifying questions about the workgroup at the beginning of the session.



**Our comments:** These are all nice approaches for welcoming new members. We feel that if the facilitator notices a new member in a meeting, they should allow time for introductions, welcoming the new member to the group, and allowing for questions. It‚Äôs important to prioritise this, and not to have such a packed agenda that there is no  time for it.

****





## Q2. Do you make changes in the meeting to make it easier for new members?

****

**Video Workgroup**

We answer questions whenever asked in the meeting.

It's about creating the right atmosphere in your meetings to make it easier for new people to speak up/ask questions if they are nervous‚Äù



**Marketing Guild**

We take more time to explain things in detail, let them ask questions.



**Gamers‚Äô Guild**

We try to open by socializing with them  - ask them for a little intro about themselves.

**Writers Workgroup**

Yes, we make out 10-15 minutes to accommodate the newcomers and give a quick overview of the workgroup.



**Translations Workgroup**

We don't hold meetings.



**Governance Workgroup**

In our meetings everyone does participate - Felix usually facilitates, but others chip in,  we ask quieter people if they have any input, If someone is very quiet and has questions, we use async comms on Discord or DMs to answer new people's questions.



**Archives Workgroup**

We go a bit more slowly and show them how the board works, invite them to comment - sometimes it can feel a bit unnerving to talk in a new meeting if you're not invited to, so we try to ask people for their views etc, explain background info that they might not know



**Knowledge Base Workgroup**

No, actually it is built in to the meeting structure and the regular agenda. I do allow changes in agenda and try to also get consent (on the agenda). Sometimes we go through the process of one of the tasks to show how it is done.



**Our comments:**

It's nice to see a little time allocated in meetings for new members if any is available.

****





## Q3. Is there any info you share with new people?



**Onboarding Workgroup**

Our key docs are at the top of our agenda doc, which is shared before every meeting.



**Video Workgroup**

https://vw-snetambassadors.carrd.co/



**Marketing Guild**

Links to the most important sites/channels (social media, dework, snet website, resources we use)

Any documents that have been created around the WG/Guild

Share all relevant WGs that are connected to the marketing guild (Writers, Video, Translations).



**Gamers‚Äô Guild**

At the end of the session we do a little exploration of SNet - e.g. in one session we talked about Ben Goertzel.



**Writers Workgroup**

We share the test [this is the test that people need to take in order to join the workgroup] and the editing framework used to take the test



**Translations Workgroup**

The process involved in translation: there's a definite process on how translations  are done.



**Governance Workgroup**

Not really, just the meetings. When I start convos about governance I refer people to Photrek‚Äôs whitepapers, here and here , and Sociocracy for All as a resource, and Elinor Ostrom and polycentric governance , and the active Zotero database on DAO governance .



**Archives Workgroup**

We always open a meeting with a quick intro to what the WG is about and what we do (and why it matters). The link to our GitHub board will be shared before meeting if we know a new person is coming, so they can have a look in advance. Also if we know they're coming, we'll point them to timestamped videos of previous meetings , If they don't have a GitHub account we can help them create one - but as yet, nobody has asked for this, ditto re guidance / training on how to use GitHub board



**Knowledge Base Workgroup**

Firstly Miro . It depends how actively they engage; the proposal we prepared for Q1 is a good overview - I guide them to that on Miro. Videos of previous sessions . Usually not pushing assets till people ask.

****

**Our comments:**

Most Workgroups do share some orienting info with new people; it's mostly done in a meeting itself or via their Discord channel.

We would suggest that new people might particularly need some background information about the tasks a group is already working on when they join, to help them catch up and be able to join in with the work. If necessary, this ‚Äúcatching people up‚Äù could even be done on a one-to-one basis.

****





## Q4. Are there any onboarding tasks that new people are required to do?



**Video Workgroup**

We have a ‚ÄúJoin the Video WorkGroup‚Äù task on Dework.



**Onboarding Workgroup**

We do it via attendance, not tasks - if someone attends 3 consecutive sessions, they get the ‚ÄúOnboarding WG‚Äù tag in Discord.



**Gamers‚Äô Guild**

Getting people to know Gamers‚Äô Guild - people might not engage with online meeting. We are considering shifting the time slot for our sessions.



**Writers Workgroup**

Yes. A copywriting test is administered.



**Translations Workgroup**

Yes, an interview is conducted and then a translation task.



**Governance Workgroup**

Nope



**Archives Workgroup**

No.



**Knowledge Base Workgroup**

No.



**Our comments:**

Some workgroups need a specifc onboarding task or even a test for new members, and some don‚Äôt.

But given that our research shows that people tend to feel more onboarded when they are given tasks to do, even groups which don't have a specific onboarding task could find it hepful to ensure that they do have some entry-level tasks (tasks that people can jump straight into, without needing a lot of experience) available at all times, so that new people can quickly get involved in the work of the group.





## Q5. How do new people  officially become members?



**Video Workgroup**

After they finish the first task they become members and they are officially welcomed in the next WG meeting.



**Onboarding Workgroup**

By attending 3 consecutive meetings then getting the Discord tag ‚ÄúOnboarding WG‚Äù.



**Gamers‚Äô Guild**

No official role - anyone's free to join. Winning games = rewards!



**Writers Workgroup**

Upon a successful submission of the test, the WG lead has a one-on-one meeting with them to provide them with what they'll need moving forward.



**Translations Workgroup**

If the translation is done correctly, they become a member and are given the Translator tag in Discord.



**Governance Workgroup**

By constantly engaging. We use GovWG tokens to recognise engagements. This is an area where improvement would be helpful - a clear definition of membership would help people understand the Ambassadors program and feel welcome.



**Archives Workgroup**

No "official membership" - just by coming to meetings and doing work. Generally, we make someone a member of our GitHub once they agree to do a task for the workgroup (although some people are members already, through having the Ambassador role).



**Knowledge Base Workgroup**

**‚Äú** Just showing up‚Äù isn't quite it, but it gives you an idea what we do - but completing an async task gets you the Discord role. After that, each time you join a meeting you get rewarded, sometimes we do the async tasks in the meeting itself.



**Our comments:**

If there is anything our previous onboarding survey showed us, it‚Äôs that most people actually feel onboarded after been given a task. We don't think this should necessarily be a criterion to join a workgroup, but it seems to be helpful for several workgroups.









## Q6. What is your retention rate? (in other words, when new people attend your group, how many of them keep coming back?)



**Video Workgroup**

62.5%



**Onboarding Workgroup**

Over 50% I think.



**Gamers‚Äô Guild**

100%, Frequency of joining is good, and people do tend to keep coming back after only 1 session.



**Writers Workgroup**

Some scribblers drop out here and there but many stay. But if we had more scribblers the workflow might not be as smooth. (NOTE: a ‚Äúscribbler‚Äù is the WorkGroup‚Äôs name for a person who has passed the initial test and has officially joined the group.)

****

**Translations Workgroup**

Between 90-95%.



**Governance Workgroup**

We had some tensions in Governance WG. If people come with already a perspective on governance then their views might be strong and it becomes hard to communicate.



**Archives Workgroup**

Not all that applicable - people who come to meetings tend to be quite engaged already with the program, and they hop in and out when they need to. A bit like Treasury meetings in that respect.



**Knowledge Base Workgroup**

Low-ish. I assume it's because:

maybe people are not reading the Dework

maybe they didn't understand what was going on in 1st session and don't come back

high expectations

The reason people want to contribute shouldn't be the rewards - it should be about the topics and the culture.



**Our comments:**

Retention rates are reasonably high - but we note that ‚Äúretention‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean someone attending every meeting - some groups function more like a drop-in, so retention might mean someone feeling able to turn up when they want to. It‚Äôs also important to note that workgroups need to think about their capacity and budget when thinking about new people joining - they need to grow organically.

# Improvements



## Q1. Could your ‚Äúcontinuous onboarding‚Äù be improved?



**Video Workgroup**

Yes, better documentation on how to do some recurring tasks, better documentation for the Q/A doc. That would help newcomers get involved quickly and do their first task & build from there.



**Marketing Guild**

Almost certainly - yes. But I feel like we should ask the new people themselves about it.



**Gamers‚Äô Guild**

Yes. Partnership with Onboarding WG? so new members can get engaged with other things happening in Ambassadors program. They also a need introductory 1-2-1 sessions to know more about the ecosystem, in depth on SNET, how they can become ambassadors, invest themselves, and contribute.



**Translations Workgroup**

Yes, there's always room for improvement. For now, the process is good as it is, but could change in the future.



**Governance Workgroup**

An overview on what people should expect would be a good idea?

What should a WG say about itself??‚Äù



it's easy to criticize and hard to do things, If anyone steps up to run the WG, I'll support - WG lead is more a facilitator than a decision-maker.

I have lots of individual ideas on how I see it, but i wouldn't promote them - it's the WG who figures that out. I aim to become obsolete.

i prefer more structure, so a good WG has very clear roles and mission, and there is a definition of gaps that a new person could fill - but I have accepted it's not the way this group likes to work



**Archives Workgroup.**

Yes,

We would like to be able to help engage new people with open-source tooling: GitHub and more. We might create a short video to show new people how the Problems Board works, for example, or run a one-off session about it.

More bounties and entry-level tasks would help.

If a new person shows up, we could spend more time on asking them about themselves - what they'd like to learn about Archives, what skills they'd like to share, what other groups they are involved with - i.e. try and build a connection with them and the other WGs they go to, rather than expecting them to come to every Archives meeting.

We might think more about what we present at Town Halls to encourage people to join meetings - e.g. share links to meeting recordings... though we do have to recognise that we are unlikely to have floods of people joining meetings. For Archives, continuous onboarding might be more about how we connect with and help documenters in other WGs.



**Knowledge Base Workgroup**

Yes.

Feedback form? Feedback form is another thing that is async.

Telling people "Did you know XYZ is possible?", this info gives me the insight of how to structure the onboarding process, include links back to Ambassadors overall from the Knowledge Base Dework.



**Our comments:**

There is always room for improvements; but each WorkGroup needs to do onboarding in the way that suits them.

Perhaps a quarterly ‚Äúcross-program‚Äù Onboarding session would really go a long way - something for new members and for anyone who still feels yet to be onboarded, thereby providing assistance and educating them on all they need to know on SNet and the Ambassador program .



****

## Q2. Any other comments?



**Archives Workgroup**

Possibly we have to recognise that Archives tends to be something people only come to after they have been involved for a while. A lot of our "continuous onboarding" is about links with other WGs and archiving their stuff.







# Conclusion

Firstly, we would love to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to making this Continuous Onboarding research a success. Your support truly made a difference, and we are grateful for your efforts.



Onboarding is a process, and it takes time and effort to create a comfortable space for new members and existing members in the program. For this, we recommend that Workgroups consider allocating something in their budgets for continuous onboarding of members.



We know that sometimes there can be worries about new people coming into a Workgroup, and potentially changing things or disrupting the familiarities and relationships among existing members. Yes, we know; and it‚Äôs normal to feel that way - but with new people in the program you get to have:



Fresh perspectives: New members bring different viewpoints and ideas, fostering innovation and creativity.

Increased diversity: With new members joining, the program becomes more diverse in terms of backgrounds, experiences, and expertise, enriching the community and promoting inclusivity.

Expanded network: Each new member adds to the program's network, potentially opening up new opportunities for collaboration, partnerships, and connections.

Enhanced skill sets: New members often possess unique skills and knowledge that complement existing members, allowing for a more comprehensive and versatile skill set within the program.

Growth and sustainability: The influx of new members can lead to increased engagement, participation, and momentum, contributing to the program's long-term growth and sustainability.



So with this, we strongly recommend that Workgroups should know the importance of continuous onboarding of members, and appreciate the importance of their role in it. ****
