> Context - on Zoom
> * Vanessa Cardui: I was thinking - should we add the Zoom registration link here? Or is that just asking for trouble, lol?

If we don't include it, should we add something to say where people can find it (e.g. "find the link on our Calendar" and add the calendar link?) (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Um, I think adding something like “you can find the link on discord event tabs” in a bracket will do. I mean if they've followed the steps before that particular tweet then it shouldn't be a problem.

I don't know about everyone but putting out our calendar makes me feel exposed 😂 not that it's a bad idea.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yeh agree

👉Dive into Dework (We use Dework  to track and reward people's work. The Getting-Started channel on Discord will tell you how to use it ). Sign up, and complete the Introduction task.

👉Next step: get involved with our Workgroups (e.g. Writers workgroup, Video workgroup, Archives workgroup, etc) and Guilds (Education Guild, Gamers Guild, Marketing Guild, etc) Participating in any Workgroup and Guild of your choice is how you work towards becoming an Ambassador.

> Context - etc
> * Vanessa Cardui: I think maybe it'll attract attention if we  mention that we have a Gamers Guild (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Yeah, added that🔅

> Context - etc
> * Vanessa Cardui: if there is space, would love to squeeeeeeeeeze Archives Workgroup in, lol) (Resolved by Love Owokere)
