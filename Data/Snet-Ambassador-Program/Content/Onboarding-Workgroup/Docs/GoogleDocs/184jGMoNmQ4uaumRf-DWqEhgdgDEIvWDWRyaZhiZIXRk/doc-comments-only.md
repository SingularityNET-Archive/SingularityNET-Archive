#### Context - on Zoom
> * Vanessa Cardui: I was thinking - should we add the Zoom registration link here? Or is that just asking for trouble, lol?

If we don't include it, should we add something to say where people can find it (e.g. "find the link on our Calendar" and add the calendar link?) (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Um, I think adding something like “you can find the link on discord event tabs” in a bracket will do. I mean if they've followed the steps before that particular tweet then it shouldn't be a problem.

I don't know about everyone but putting out our calendar makes me feel exposed 😂 not that it's a bad idea.
