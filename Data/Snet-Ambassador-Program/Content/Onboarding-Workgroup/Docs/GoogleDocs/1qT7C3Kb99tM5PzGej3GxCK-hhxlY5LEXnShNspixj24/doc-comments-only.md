#### Context - Which should it be - everyone in the program., or just LTCs plus those attending the WG, or just LTCs?
> * Tevo Saks: Just LTC based on those options.
if the new workgroup members want to empower the new group, they now have an incentive to join other existing workgroups and apply themselves, which also requires a bit of time to learn how we do things here.
>   - Tevo Saks: I think it is inevitable that the first thing before initiating the proposal consent process, we update LTC list
> 
#### Context - Attendance: how many people attended, and what was the retention rate? (If attendance was small, then is there any suggestion for why that was? Do they need more time to build a community, more support with promoting themselves, etc? Or was a low attendance actually what was needed in order for them to focus and establish themselves?
> * Tevo Saks: if attendance is tracked trough tasks that are imported to treasury then Treasury Guild can provide an Attendance numbers and rate report from the Treasury
> 
#### Context - I would say no, because a) this would add extra overhead for Treasury; b) we need to verify whether the group can manage their budget on their own.
> * Tevo Saks: We will still see and check the tasks, sometimes there are misunderstandings how to task points or rewarding works. So it doesn't actually that much overhead to flag requests.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yeh, but that's just the same scrutiny that Treasury would give to any WG, no? The question being asked is, should Treasury give any ***special*** scrutiny to the new WG's budget requests - and I'd say no, they shouldn't
> 
#### Context - Can we say they must submit meeting summaries? or should it be optional?
> * Tevo Saks: I would be ok it as requirement at some point.
But when we started we also didn't make meeting summaries for quite a while. So perhaps we allow 4 sessions without summaries for new workgroup leads
> 
#### Context - The proposer doesn’t have to be the person who will actually run or facilitate the WG; but if they’re not, the proposal should specify who will do it.
> * Tevo Saks: in the last Governance Workgroup call when I asked about creating positions with WG budget, but not guaranteed to be filled in the quarter is allowed.

However, the sense I got its fine for small ~100$ budgets and it quickly becomes a case by case study based on proposal
> 
#### Context - Should we decide one place where new WG proposals get discussed; or should it be “any of the above”?
> * Nwobi Onyeka: Personally I feel long term contributors can have a separate call for decision making, it can be bi weekly
> 
#### Context - The proposer can be anyone - they don’t have to be a longterm contributor. Someone can come in to the community and immediately suggest a new WG if they like. (
> * Nwobi Onyeka: I think commitment is important in this situation, we don't need people that will leave after his/her proposal is accepted or rejected
> 
#### Context - The proposer can be anyone - they don’t have to be a longterm contributor. Someone can come in to the community and immediately suggest a new WG if they like.
> * Love Owokere: Are you sure that the said “proposer” won't be ignored if they are new to the community? I mean, some people might think he/she/they are not fully informed(On SNET and the SNET Ambassador program) to suggest setting up a new WG :-)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Yupyupyup, you're right that it's definitely a concern. I'm trying to address it by 

1) having this really simple initial suggestion phase, theat just says "Yeah, you can work up a proposal" - it maybe raises a bit of awareness about the proposed WG? and 

2) saying that the actual proposal itself (the next phase) needs to have at least one seconder who's properly involved in the community, and who could be a bit of an advocate for the proposed WG.

But can you think of any other ways we can remove those potential barriers...?
>   - Tevo Saks: We operate in an environment where people choose networks based on our values. Leaving it open  introduces easier onboarding for new service offers, but I do see value in expecting new people to first visit a few workshops, spend a few hours to add value to initiative. And then obtain a status to suggest new spaces(guilds/WG) to create
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Maybe true, yeh - but I also think that often, it'll be the new person/outsider who can see what is missing and what's needed. I wouldn't want to stop a new person from at least the initial suggesting of a new WG.
What I have tried to do, tho, is ensure that the new idea makes sense to the values of the existing cohort, by saying that in the 2nd phase (actually writing a proposal for a new WG), the proposer needs a seconder (or maybe more than one seconder) who is already a long-term contributor. This would mean a new person can't just march in and start pushing for something that flies in the face of our existing values...
