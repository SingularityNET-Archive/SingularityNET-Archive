# A suggested process for starting a Workgroup in the Ambassador program





## 1) Initial suggestion phase (I’m suggesting this as a new step in the process)



The initial suggestion for a new WG should be made by one person - the “proposer”.



To avoid wasting the proposer’s time and effort, this initial suggestion should be simply “I propose a new WG about XYZ”, rather than a fully worked proposal. Thus, if there is strong opposition, the proposer will be aware of it before they have invested lots of effort.



The initial suggestion should be made in the Ambassador-General channel in Discord, and then raised in a TH. (Have a standing item in TH for “suggestion of new WGs”?)



The proposer can be anyone - they don’t have to be a longterm contributor. Someone can come in to the community and immediately suggest a new WG if they like. (unsure about this - thoughts?)

> * Love Owokere: Are you sure that the said “proposer” won't be ignored if they are new to the community? I mean, some people might think he/she/they are not fully informed(On SNET and the SNET Ambassador program) to suggest setting up a new WG :-)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Yupyupyup, you're right that it's definitely a concern. I'm trying to address it by 

1) having this really simple initial suggestion phase, theat just says "Yeah, you can work up a proposal" - it maybe raises a bit of awareness about the proposed WG? and 

2) saying that the actual proposal itself (the next phase) needs to have at least one seconder who's properly involved in the community, and who could be a bit of an advocate for the proposed WG.

But can you think of any other ways we can remove those potential barriers...?
>   - Tevo Saks: We operate in an environment where people choose networks based on our values. Leaving it open  introduces easier onboarding for new service offers, but I do see value in expecting new people to first visit a few workshops, spend a few hours to add value to initiative. And then obtain a status to suggest new spaces(guilds/WG) to create
>   - Vanessa Cardui: Maybe true, yeh - but I also think that often, it'll be the new person/outsider who can see what is missing and what's needed. I wouldn't want to stop a new person from at least the initial suggesting of a new WG.
What I have tried to do, tho, is ensure that the new idea makes sense to the values of the existing cohort, by saying that in the 2nd phase (actually writing a proposal for a new WG), the proposer needs a seconder (or maybe more than one seconder) who is already a long-term contributor. This would mean a new person can't just march in and start pushing for something that flies in the face of our existing values...

The proposer needn’t be the person who will actually manage the WG - but if not, they should say so.



The longterm contributors (LTCs) should then decide whether or not to give provisional approval to proceed with the idea. Reasons to **not** approve at this stage should be a defined set of possibilities - I suggest:

“ We already have a WG that does that ”;

“ We don’t have space/ budget for more WGs at present ”,

“ We are actively opposed to having a WG that does that ”

“We recently rejected a similar WG” .

Anything else?

If none of these apply, the proposer can proceed to a full proposal.

**NOTE** : this is only about giving approval to work up a proper proposal - nothing more. So there would have to be a really strong reason to block it at this stage - but it does avoid someone spending ages working up a proposal for something the Program doesn’t want.



The decision to approve at this stage should be made by whatever process the LTCs are currently using. If they are using more than 1 process, I suggest using consent for this - i.e. if everyone is willing to let the proposer create a proposal, and nobody objects enough to say that it is “not safe to proceed”, then go ahead.  So i f there are no objections, or if objections are able to be fixed through discussion, the proposer works up a written proposal for the new WG.



**NOTE:** We need to include something here about timing, a) so that there is enough time for the community to decide on a new WG; and b) so that the new WG’s initial budget can be put in place for the start of a Quarter. So while an initial suggestion can be made at any time,

it cannot be implemented for at least 1 month after the initial suggestion, and

it will only be implemented at the start of a quarter.

So the fastest way would therefore be  to submit a suggestion one month before the end of a Quarter, so that it can be implemented at the start of the **next** quarter.





## 2) Proposal

A proposal should be submitted by one proposer, and supported by at least two “seconders”, at least one of whom should be a long-term contributor. (In other words, to propose a new WG you need to gather some support from the community first.)



The proposer doesn’t have to be the person who will actually run or facilitate the WG; but if they’re not, the proposal should specify who **will** do it.



The proposer (with the help of the seconders if needed) should write a proposal document, to propose the new WG. This should cover, at minimum:

why the WG is needed, and how it will help the Ambassador program

broadly what kind of activities the WG will do (Optionally can set out specific activities that will be done in the WG’s first quarter)

who will facilitate or run the group (at least for its first quarter)

an idea of how many people are currently interested in attending, and whether they are already involved in the program, or new

what skills someone could use, or learn, by attending this WG

how often the proposed WG would meet (if it meets at all. It could be async.)

how the WG’s activities could be audited or tracked

any risks, and how they will be mitigated

a budget for what the group’s core activities would cost for its first quarter. This will probably comprise both running costs (facilitation, documenting, managing) and core activities. Should there be a maximum that this initial budget can be?

Is there any other info we’d need in order to be able to make an informed decision?



## 2) Share proposal, and provisional approval

The proposers should share their proposal in the Ambassador-General channel in Discord, making the doc open for comments.

There should be a box to tick in the doc, for Long Term Contributors to confirm they have seen it and read it. (Can we say they have a duty to read it? or can they abstain? )

The doc should then be discussed in an appropriate meeting - maybe Governance, Strategy or Onboarding, or a Town Hall? Should we decide one place where new WG proposals get discussed; or should it be “any of the above”?

> * Nwobi Onyeka: Personally I feel long term contributors can have a separate call for decision making, it can be bi weekly
>

In this meeting, t he Long-term Contributors (LTCs) should decide whether to give the WG provisional approval, which means approval to go ahead, with the proposed budget, for a period of one Quarter.

The decision should be split into 2 parts:

approval in principle for the WG to run for a trial period of a Quarter

approval of the suggested budget.

These 2 decisions should be made using whatever methodology the LTCs are currently using.

If LTCs agree the principle but not the detail of the budget, we should work to reach consensus on how much budget the WG can have for their trial period.



## 3) Initial budget agreement and trial period

If the WG is provisionally approved, then as of the start of the **next** Quarter, the WG will be able to submit fund requests up to their agreed budget limit. This will come from “New Ideas” budget? (and will therefore reduce the available amount for existing WGs?)

The new WG will meet for that quarter, and will document their meetings like any other WG.

They will be assigned a mentor from amongst the LTCs who they can approach if they have any queries. (It would be unfair if they failed because they didn’t have needed support; so we should make every effort to set them up to succeed. So - do people agree that this mentorship role should be a thing? Should it be rewarded, and how much? If yes, should a new WG’s proposal include a  standard “mentorship fee” as a mandatory element? Should the mentor be one of the “seconders” who initially supported the WG’s proposal? Do we need to write a standard on what a mentor should do as a minimum - or does it depend, and can mentor and WG be left to work it out between them? )

At the end of the Quarter the WG will submit a report.



## 4) Trial period meetings and reporting

The new WG will meet, and do the work they agreed on in their proposal, for the whole Quarter.

They will give updates at the last TH of each month, like any other WG.

Can we say they must submit meeting summaries? or should it be optional?

> * Tevo Saks: I would be ok it as requirement at some point.
But when we started we also didn't make meeting summaries for quite a while. So perhaps we allow 4 sessions without summaries for new workgroup leads
>

Can we say that they will simply run, like any other group, or do we need Treasury to give any special scrutiny to their budget requests? I would say no, because a) this would add extra overhead for Treasury; b) we need to verify whether the group can manage their budget on their own.

> * Tevo Saks: We will still see and check the tasks, sometimes there are misunderstandings how to task points or rewarding works. So it doesn't actually that much overhead to flag requests.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yeh, but that's just the same scrutiny that Treasury would give to any WG, no? The question being asked is, should Treasury give any ***special*** scrutiny to the new WG's budget requests - and I'd say no, they shouldn't
>

At the end of the Quarter, the new workgroup will submit a report, which must cover:

Work: what work did they do? Does it tally with what their proposal said they would do? (NB If it doesn’t, this isn’t necessarily bad - e.g. if they’re responding to changing circumstances - but they do need to explain why)

Successes: what do they feel their main successes were?

Problems: any problems they can identify, what were the reasons for those, and how will they address them if they continue?

Future work: through meeting for a quarter, have they identified any specific future direction(s) they think the WG should go in, if it is formally approved? Do they want to modify their original proposal at all?

Budget: did they spend what they said they would, and did they spend it on what they said? Were they transparent and financially organised?

Attendance: how many people attended, and what was the retention rate? (If attendance was small, then is there any suggestion for why that was? Do they need more time to build a community, more support with promoting themselves, etc? Or was a low attendance actually what was needed in order for them to focus and establish themselves?

## 5) Assessment, and approval or not

I suggest that anyone in the program who has read the WG’s report should be allowed to contribute to making the decision - not just the LTCs. At the very least, attendees/members of the WG should have a voice, even if they are not LTCs. Which should it be - everyone in the program., or just LTCs plus those attending the WG, or just LTCs? 

> [Comments]
> Context - Which should it be - everyone in the program., or just LTCs plus those attending the WG, or just LTCs?
> * Tevo Saks: Just LTC based on those options.
if the new workgroup members want to empower the new group, they now have an incentive to join other existing workgroups and apply themselves, which also requires a bit of time to learn how we do things here.
>   - Tevo Saks: I think it is inevitable that the first thing before initiating the proposal consent process, we update LTC list
>

The decision will be made by whatever methodology the LTCs are currently using - e.g. consent, or a vote, or whatever it might be.

The decision the first time can be “Yes” (workgroup is formally accepted) or “More time” (the WG gets to meet for another Quarter with the same basic budget).

Possibly we should say the decision cannot be “no” at this point, since we know from experience that almost all existing WGs took at least a Quarter to establish themselves and get going, so it would be unfair to reject a group outright at this point. Or possibly - we should have a defined set of circumstances in which case the decision CAN be an outright “no” at this stage - for example,

no attendees

clear evidence of financial mismanagement

failing to deliver a quarterly report

anything else?

If the decision is “yes”, then that’s that - the WG is formally accepted as a WG like any other.

If the decision is “More time”, then the WG must be given clear reasons why they were not accepted.

(Note: this means that if the LTCs are using, for example, a majority vote process to make decisions, this information about the reasons why will need to be collected separately somehow, since it won’t be available from the vote per se .)

(Note also that this would mean that if the decision-makers cannot give at least one clear reason why the answer isn’t “yes” - then the answer actually has to be “yes”.)

The WG then meets for a second Quarter, with the same basic budget, and makes a report at the end, as before. But  this time their report must include addressing the issues they were told they needed to improve on.

At the end of their 2nd quarter as a provisional WG, the decisonmaking group - whether that is just LTCs, or LTCs plus workgroup attendees, or everyone - must decide firmly yes or no.

If “yes”, the WG is formally accepted as a WG like any other.

If “no”, they will no longer receive any funding.

The decision and the reasons should be recorded, and should feed into a doc (or other text-based knowledge base) about what sorts of things can go wrong with a new WG and be a reason to reject them.

For documentation, we should keep a log of all new WG proposals, how far they got, the decision process used, who decided, and the reasons the WG was rejected or accepted.



## 6) Re-application

A WG that has been refused - or a WG that is very similar in its initial proposal to one that has been refused - cannot reapply for 2 quarters? 3 quarters? more? after being refused. This is to prevent an endless cycle of a WG re-proposing (and getting a basic budget) over and over again, with versions that are only slightly different each Quarter.

Possibly, the proposer and seconders of a rejected WG should not be able to propose another, different WG for 2 or 3 quarters either, to avoid the situation of a person repeatedly proposing random workgroups and making no effort to deliver anything.
