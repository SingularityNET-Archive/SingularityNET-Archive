#### Context - We should keep the name “Core Contributor” for the decisionmaking role in the Ambassador Program.
> * Vanessa Cardui: I'm feeling a bit that the name itself is a bit of a red herring, and we should be asking for consent to continue to have "core contributors" as the decision makers.
> 
#### Context - you can’t object unless the proposal being passed would actually affect you (I guess that applies to everyone, so OK)
> * Clement Umoh: What happens if somebody's got a clear, valid and explainable objection that does not directly affect him/her. Does this mean this objection would be waived off despite its validity ? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: In full-on Consent decisionmaking, traditionally it's aiming to overturn entrenched power. Consent processes (and similar approaches) aim to foreground the needs of those who are closest to a decision, and are actually going to be affected by it; and reduce the amount of decisionmaking power that is given to people who are remote from the issue and just talking theoretically about things they have little understanding of. Which is what often happens in wider-world decisionmaking - those with power are usually making top-down decisions about things that will never affect them (think of super-rich politicians making decisions on poverty); and those who are affected have little influence, and are just passive and acted-upon.

In our kind of community, though, that's waaaaay less of an issue - and for this specific decision, ofc, like we've said, all of the decisionmakers (i.e. the core contributors) *are* affected by the issue, so it wouldn't arise.
>   - Clement Umoh: Great. Thanks !

#### Context - Last time we made a decision, we used a Google form - this time, we will be using the tool CitizenOS (maybe include screenshots? or explain how people will log in - own account?) NB we need to include info on privacy here - can people see what you say and see that it’s you
> * Clement Umoh: Are people really familiar with this tool ? It would be essential that this tool is easily adapted to. This will facilitate more contributions as opposed to if lots of persons are unable to use this tool.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: it's a good point! But
a) CitizenOS is super-duper simple (imo too simple, lol)
b) I don't actually think we're going to be using it for this decision anyway - to be discussed tho, in Governance WG
> 
#### Context - Does it need any context setting on how Core Contribs came about?
> * Anonymous: To me I feel there should be a context setting, so that others especially new members will know why the Core Contributors are the decision makers and will know how Core Contributors got to where they are, this alone will motivate them. 
I think it is necessary
>   - Vanessa Cardui: hi Anon - I've tried to fit this background context into the section above - do you think it's enough detail?
> 
#### Context - Is it “propose to call it Core Contributor permanently”?
> * Kateri Nick: I propose to call a decision making role permanently to the Core contributors.
Cause the name signifies the meaning, for someone to have the right to make decisions the people must be a core contributor to that particular WG and not just someone that comes once in a blue moon. (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: OK let's go with that, then :-)
> 
#### Context - would budget come partly from Governance and  partly Onboarding, or all fro  Governance?
> * Vanessa Cardui: this might not be an issue, cos we might not be planning to use a new tool anyway. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on whether we should?
> 
#### Context - The proposal is “We should rename the decisionmaking role in the Program
> * Vanessa Cardui: so the decision makiing role is currently called "core contributor".
So we're deciding on whether to change that or keep it (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
> 
#### Context - We should rename the decisionmaking role in the Program from “Ambassador” to something else TBD”.
> * Vanessa Cardui: This has to an extent already happened de facto. We're not giving any new people the Ambassador tag; those who have the tag already are not the decisionmaking group; etc. 

Do we need to explain this to people maybe?

Does the proposal need to be for a permanent change or a temporary one? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
> 
#### Context - maybe the fact that
> * Vanessa Cardui: I see what you mean - but I’m talking more generically what kinds of reasons are valid in this kind of process. 

I think it’s super-important that we don’t say anything here about what the specific reasons for this decision might be, or it could come across like we are trying to skew the process. (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
> 
#### Context - I think better to add just key principles of how consent processes work
> * Love Owokere: Let's just do this here, because the other doc will be confusing. Maybe a quick summary of what we are doing? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
> 
#### Context - maybe include screenshots? or explain how people will log in - own account?)
> * Love Owokere: From my experience, screenshots don't get the job done. I'd say a short video or a screen record.
I don't even know how to use CitizenOS lol (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yup agree - but people have been looking at CitizenOS and it is bloody awful imo... lol I'd kinda like to push for not using it :-) - I have no idea why the reviewers in Strategy Guild said it could support consent decisionmaking. It can't :-(
