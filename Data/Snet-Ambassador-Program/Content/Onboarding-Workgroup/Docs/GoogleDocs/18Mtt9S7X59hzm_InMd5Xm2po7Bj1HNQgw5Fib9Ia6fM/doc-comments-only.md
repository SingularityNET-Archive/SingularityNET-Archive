#### Context - Does it need any context setting on how Core Contribs came about?
> * Anonymous: To me I feel there should be a context setting, so that others especially new members will know why the Core Contributors are the decision makers and will know how Core Contributors got to where they are, this alone will motivate them. 
I think it is necessary
> 
#### Context - Is it “propose to call it Core Contributor permanently”?
> * Nick Nick: I propose to call a decision making role permanently to the Core contributors.
Cause the name signifies the meaning, for someone to have the right to make decisions the people must be a core contributor to that particular WG and not just someone that comes once in a blue moon.

#### Context - would budget come partly from Governance and  partly Onboarding, or all fro  Governance?
> * Vanessa Cardui: this might not be an issue, cos we might not be planning to use a new tool anyway. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on whether we should?

#### Context - The proposal is “We should rename the decisionmaking role in the Program
> * Vanessa Cardui: so the decision makiing role is currently called "core contributor".
So we're deciding on whether to change that or keep it
> 
#### Context - We should rename the decisionmaking role in the Program from “Ambassador” to something else TBD”.
> * Vanessa Cardui: This has to an extent already happened de facto. We're not giving any new people the Ambassador tag; those who have the tag already are not the decisionmaking group; etc. 

Do we need to explain this to people maybe?

Does the proposal need to be for a permanent change or a temporary one? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)

#### Context - maybe the fact that
> * Vanessa Cardui: I see what you mean - but I’m talking more generically what kinds of reasons are valid in this kind of process. 

I think it’s super-important that we don’t say anything here about what the specific reasons for this decision might be, or it could come across like we are trying to skew the process. (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)

#### Context - I think better to add just key principles of how consent processes work
> * Love Owokere: Let's just do this here, because the other doc will be confusing. Maybe a quick summary of what we are doing? (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
> 
#### Context - maybe include screenshots? or explain how people will log in - own account?)
> * Love Owokere: From my experience, screenshots don't get the job done. I'd say a short video or a screen record.
I don't even know how to use CitizenOS lol (Resolved by Vanessa Cardui)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yup agree - but people have been looking at CitizenOS and it is bloody awful imo... lol I'd kinda like to push for not using it :-) - I have no idea why the reviewers in Strategy Guild said it could support consent decisionmaking. It can't :-(
