# Context setting for Core Contributor decision on the name of the decision-making role in the Ambassador Program



### What is the proposal?

The proposal is “We should rename the decisionmaking role in the Program from “ Core Contributor Ambassador ” to something else TBD”. 

> [Comments]
> Context - The proposal is “We should rename the decisionmaking role in the Program
> * Vanessa Cardui: so the decision makiing role is currently called "core contributor".
So we're deciding on whether to change that or keep it
>



BACKGROUND: Explain that it’s an experiment and that “Ambassador” is now a legacy role; the decisionmaking role is currently being called “Core Contributor”. Give the current Core Contrib criteria.



Which way round is is the actual proposal? Is it “propose to call it Core Contributor permanently”? Ori s it “propose to change it to something else, to be decided”?

> Context - Is it “propose to call it Core Contributor permanently”?
> * Nick Nick: I propose to call a decision making role permanently to the Core contributors.
Cause the name signifies the meaning, for someone to have the right to make decisions the people must be a core contributor to that particular WG and not just someone that comes once in a blue moon.
>



(If the latter) If the proposal is agreed, ideas will then be invited for what it should be renamed as. We are using this 2-step process to ensure that objections, if any, are about the idea of renaming per se , rather than objections to a particular proposed new name.



Note that this is **only**  about renaming the role. There is no proposal to rename the Ambassador Program.

### Who will make this decision?

Core Contributors will make the decision.(explain what they are. NB there’s currently 41 core contribs, but we agreed in Gov WG it will be recalculated each time there is a decision)



Does it need any context setting on how Core Contribs came about? Prolly not necessary

I think it is necessary

Note participation was low-ish for Q2 budgets decision, because the whole thing was a bit rushed. Need to do it better this time.



### How will the decision be made?

The decision will be made using a consent process (we could use some of , but we agreed it’s better to add just key principles of how consent processes work - if we link to the old doc it could be confusing.)  COULD link the Q1 doc in the Q2 budget decision doc

I guess just explain that Consent works by asking for any objections, and then asking what would need to change in order for the objector to consent.  Do we need to add “can’t object unless it affects u” and “can’t object unless it would cause harm?”



Last time we made a decision, we used a Google form - this time, we will be using the tool CitizenOS (maybe include screenshots? or explain how people will log in - own account?) NB we need to include info on privacy here - can people see what you say and see that it’s you?)

> * Love Owokere: From my experience, screenshots don't get the job done. I'd say a short video or a screen record.
I don't even know how to use CitizenOS lol (Resolved)
>   - Vanessa Cardui: yup agree - but people have been looking at CitizenOS and it is bloody awful imo... lol I'd kinda like to push for not using it :-) - I have no idea why the reviewers in Strategy Guild said it could support consent decisionmaking. It can't :-(

BUDGET: add a bit for walkthru videos of decision tools - would budget come partly from Governance and  partly Onboarding, or all fro  Governance?

Does anyone have any thoughts on whether we should?

SIDE ISSUE: the way we are so reading/writing-based in this ecosystem - do we need to think about this and how it excludes people? Add pictures, infographics? infographics for getting started channel? Put this in next week's agenda??? AND TRANSLATIONS!!

### What is the background to this decision?

NB here we have to ensure what we say is sourced, and isn’t just our opinion.



The idea of renaming has been mentioned and discussed several times in the Program in the past.



It was discussed at TH 9th Jan https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2024/january-2024/week-2#ambassador-town-hall



Most recently it was raised by Judith here https://discord.com/channels/909843832491896832/1206778352615292938/1206778352615292938 on 13th Feb 2024 - you can see the discussion and add to it

(Judith “After an interesting session in Marketing Guild” - Vani to find it: It seems not to have been documented - there are no Marketing summaries in Jan and Feb)



Peter saying it would be covered in TH https://discord.com/channels/909843832491896832/1206778352615292938/1207036925853306940

And it was, on 20th Feb (this is where Tommy said that he spoke to someone from the Foundatio who was against changing it from “Ambassador” https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2024/february-2024/week-8#timestamped-video



We need to hunt around for anywhere else it has been discussed - but i don’t think there’s much tbh Love to check Discord for anything else





### What else do we need to cover in this doc, if anything?

What counts as a reason for objecting to the proposal? ( i.e. maybe the fact that the role doesn't have a special value attached to it and someone would prefer to have it scraped out? I mean the real decision-makers are the core contributors - just thinking out loud btw :-)) 

> [Comments]
> Context - maybe the fact that
> * Vanessa Cardui: I see what you mean - but I’m talking more generically what kinds of reasons are valid in this kind of process. 

I think it’s super-important that we don’t say anything here about what the specific reasons for this decision might be, or it could come across like we are trying to skew the process. (Resolved)
>   - Vanessa Cardui:

In a proper consent decision-making process, people are not supposed to object unless certain conditions are fulfilled:

You need to explain your objection

You need to say what would need to change in order for you to give consent

you can’t object unless the proposal being passed would actually affect you (I guess that applies to everyone, so OK)

they feel that the proposal being passed would cause harm. (We didn’t specify this last time - the Q1 budget decision - but I am feeling we should? so maybe the decisionmaking process ought to ask people not just “What is your objection” and “what would need to change in order for you to consent?” but also “What is the harm you think it would do”?

DISCUSS THESE IN GOV WG





Should we list some pro and cons???  Agreed not - just link to where it was discussed and people can see for selves.



Pro change - NB these are about changing it **from** Ambassador, so not strictly relevamt

“Ambassador” IS widely used - but it’s not respected

What we do is not what is usually meant by “ambassador”



con change

Tommy saying it’s a widely used name and bgwigs in Panama were against changing it
