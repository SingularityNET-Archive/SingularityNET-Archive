# Context setting for Core Contributor decision on the name of the decision-making role in the Ambassador Program



### What is the proposal?

The proposal is:

**We should keep the name “Core Contributor” for the decisionmaking role in the Ambassador Program.**

> Context - We should keep the name “Core Contributor” for the decisionmaking role in the Ambassador Program.
> * Vanessa Cardui: I'm feeling a bit that the name itself is a bit of a red herring, and we should be asking for consent to continue to have "core contributors" as the decision makers.

Note: This decision is **only** about naming the role. There is no proposal to rename the Ambassador Program itself.

### Background:

In the past, the decision-making role in the SingularityNET Ambassador Program was a group called “Ambassadors”. At the end of Q4 2023 it included 9 people, and had somewhat unclear criteria and process for joining,



As an experiment in Q2 2024, this was changed - the decision-making role was renamed “Core Contributor”, and became contribution-based, with a clear process for joining. People work towards joining every time they take part in activities in the Program, and we recalculate who qualifies as a Core Contributor each time there is a decision to be made. At the most recent calculation, May 2024, there were 41 Core Contributors. A person can qualify by either time-based recognition or fund request-based recognition, or both:



Time-based recognition

Participate 12 hours in the last 6 months

Contribute at least 6 hours in the last 6 months

Must have at least some activity in the last 3 months

Fund Request recognition

Be rewarded with 1000+ AGIX for contributions in the last 3 months



And to retain the “human touch”, anyone who is not picked up by these two approaches, but who feels they should be a Core Contributor, can either be nominated or can self-nominate at the time a new calculation is done.

### Who will make this decision?

Core Contributors will make the decision.

We will recalculate who qualifies as a Core Contributor immediately before the decision process starts.

### How will the decision be made?

The decision will be made using a consent process.This works in a similar way to the WG Budget approval process that has been used this Quarter. We:

ask all Core Contributors  if they give their consent to the proposal, or if they have any objections.

if anyone does object,

ask what the objection is,

ask what harm they think it would do to proceed

ask what would need to change in order to get their consent

discuss the objection(s) in a meeting and try to reach agreement.



Note that consenting does not mean that you **agree** with the proposal - it just means you think it is “safe enough to try”. So if you raise an objection, you’re effectively saying “Doing this isn’t safe, and would cause harm”, which is why the process will ask you to define what harm you feel it will do.



Last time we made a decision, we used a Google form - this time, we will be using the tool CitizenOS  NB we need to include info on privacy here - can people see what you say and see that it’s you? )



NOTE: ideally we need an infographic to go with this doc.

### What is the background to this decision?

The idea of renaming the decision-making role from “Ambassador” to “Core Contributor” was discussed several times in the Program before the change was made as an experiment for Q2 2024; some of the points raised might be germane to the decision to continue to call the role by that name.



It was discussed at Town Hall on 9th Jan 2024

It was raised by Judith in the Forum on 13th Feb 2024 - you can see the discussion and add to it   (Judith “ After an interesting session in Marketing Guild ” - that session seems not to have been documented - there are no Marketing summaries in Jan and Feb)

It was addressed again in TH on 20th Feb 2024



(add Q2 retrospectives from Gov Guild where several people said it was a good thing)
