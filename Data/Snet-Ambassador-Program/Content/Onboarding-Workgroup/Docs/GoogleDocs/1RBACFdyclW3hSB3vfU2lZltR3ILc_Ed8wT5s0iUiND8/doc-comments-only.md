#### Context - Communication Channels
> * Vanessa Cardui: Not sure if this heading fits the content? Is it more like "Overview of the Ambassador program as a whole"? (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Yeah
That was a typo, sorry
> 
#### Context - translation
> * Vanessa Cardui: again, this makes it specific to Translator WG - I reckon we could cut this word (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: I agree
> 
#### Context - Have Translator support or
> * Vanessa Cardui: This point feels like it is specific to Translation WG. Is there any way it could be reworded to make it applicable more generally?
Would it be "have a person assigned to offer support for each core activity the WG does"? or something like that
> 
#### Context - Assign a mentor or some kind of Support
> * Vanessa Cardui: I think it might be good to add the suggestion that WGs budget for this, and pay people who do significant amounts of mentoring. Just cos it's the sort of thing that often ends up unrewarded (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Alright
> 
#### Context - learning by doing
> * Vanessa Cardui: I just wonder whether people will get what this approach is, or do we need to add a few words to explain it? It's probably obvious, but I'm not sure... (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Well
We all agreed it's obvious
> 
#### Context - surveys
> * Vanessa Cardui: It might be useful to give an example survey form that people can adapt and re-use. Tevo uses them a lot - maybe we could ask him if it's OK if we link to one of his? (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: I've asked him that
> 
#### Context - Introduction
> * Vanessa Cardui: Minor thing: I think I'd add to the intro a line or 2 to explain where we got this info from (i.e. that we visited groups in their own meetings and asked them about their approaches.) And list the groups that took part, and thank them. (Resolved by Love Owokere)
> 
#### Context - Introduction
> * Vanessa Cardui: In general it's great - but I feel like some things which are currently separate, actually belong under the same heading. 

So my main general comment is, maybe fewer headings, but with more ideas under each one, so that similar ideas are grouped together. (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Yeah
This is true
> 
#### Context - helping people KNOW theyâ€™re contributing
> * Vanessa Cardui: There have been some suggestions on hpw to do this on the Miro - could we add a few here? (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Sure
I just don't know where to get that
> 
#### Context - Please ensure that it is clear
> * Vanessa Cardui: Is this partly about adding info to the Ambassador GitBook? If yes, mention that - and maybe even tell people how to update their GitBook info, link the doc, and maybe even say that Sucre will be contacting them?) 
But I think it's also about WGs discussing these things and coming up with answers to these questions, right?
>   - Love Owokere: Yeah. It's more about WGs discussing them
>   - Vanessa Cardui: cool - maybe needs a bit of a rephrase, so
> 
#### Context - Resources
> * Vanessa Cardui: should we link the Miro here as well? Not sure (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Yeah
I will do that in a bit
> 
#### Context - Here&#39;s a detailed breakdown of ideas and potential improvements
> * Vanessa Cardui: Another general suggestion I have is to give credit where it's due.
So I mean - If you're suggesting something, note where the idea came from. For example "One thing that KB WG does is..." or "Writers WG has tried this and found it helps" or "Video WG are thinking of trying X"

Cos after all, we got all these ideas from the WGs themselves, and it would be nice to acknowledge it. It wouldn't have to be for every single point, ofc, but just throw it in here and there.

Just a suggestion - feel free not to use, if you don't think it works! (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: I've added this somehow, thanks!
> 
#### Context - concise overview
> * Vanessa Cardui: Where is this suggesting that this overview should be provided?
Pinned to the top of your Discord channel?
Something you say at the start of every meeting?
Something you send to prospective new members?
Something you say in TH updates?
Other?
All of the above?

I think this point should be a bit more specific (Resolved by Love Owokere)
> 
#### Context - Feedback Collection
> * Vanessa Cardui: Aren't the 2 points under this heading the same thing? Or is "feedback mechanisms" talking about something other than forms or interviews? If so I think it would be good to say what kind of mechanisms (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Yep
> 
#### Context - for gaming sessions
> * Vanessa Cardui: I'd lose this, as it makes it specific to Ganmers Guild. Just "in your sessions"? (Resolved by Love Owokere)
>   - Love Owokere: Yep, thanks
> 
#### Context - Offer a variety of resources and services
> * Vanessa Cardui: Again, making resources is a lot of work, and requires a bit of planning. If we're suggesting it, I reckon it needs to be more like "Think about whether you need any resources, and if so, budget for making them in your quarterly budget". 

Also it's almost certainly just me, but I'm a bit unclear what kind of thing is meant by "services" here?
>   - Love Owokere: Lol
The services here isn't like the service you think, it's more like support when needed. But then again maybe it isn't the right word
> 
#### Context - Develop some context-setting / educative material about any issues that the community is making decisions on, before the decision is made, to help new people get to grips with the issue.
> * Vanessa Cardui: This is a biiiiiig thing - and it wasn't really something that came out of the "continuous onboarding" sessions, but out of our survey. I think it would be a lot to expect most WGs to do this individually - it's kinda a collaborative piece of work, something we were thinking Onboarding, Education, maybe Strategy, and maybe R&D would do some specific work on this quarter.

Not sure it should be here, but i could be wrong - what do you reckon?
>   - Love Owokere: Since it's something we are still thinking about, I'll remove it
> 
#### Context - archival
> * Vanessa Cardui: Could remove this word, as it makes it specific to Archives WG, whe these tips should be general

I also feel like this sentence is kinda wordy, and I'm not that sure what it's saying. What kinds of communication channels? Groups all have a Discord channel - is this suggesting something else as well, or just saying "think about how you use your Discord" channel"?
> 
#### Context - Archives
> * Vanessa Cardui: ditto - replace with "the group's"
> 
#### Context - archival
> * Vanessa Cardui: I think we could take out this word, as it's specific to Archives WG.
