# Reinforcing Continuous Onboarding in Workgroups/Guilds:

Ideas and Improvements





## Acronyms used in this doc: WG s - Workgroups  SNET - SingularityNET



# Introduction



Thi s document comprises ideas we got from analysis of our survey (December 2023 ) on how people feel about the current onboarding p rocess ; and from the  continuous onboarding sessions (November and December 2023 ) we ran with Governance WG, Knowledge Base WG, Writers WG, Video WG, Gamers Guild, Translations WG, Archives WG, and Marketing Guild in their respective meetings.



It explores what WGs/Guilds can do to strengthen **continuous onboarding** (the process of ‚Äúfeeling onboarded‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt over once someone joins our Discord or attends a Town Hall, but which our research shows is ongoing, takes time, and happens mostly within WorkGroups).









# Here's a detailed breakdown of ideas and potential improvementsüëá



Note that most of these ideas were developed by WGs/Guilds themselves, and are already being successfully used; other WGs might want to adopt them too.



## 1. Give an overview of your Workgroup/Guild



Provide a concise overview of the Guild/Workgroup‚Äôs purpose, current topics, recent projects, and how members can get involved. This could be pinned in your Discord channel, said at the start of every meeting, or whatever works best for the WG/Guild.  This would help people who are shy, confused, or stopping by to learn ‚Äú **what exactly happens here** ‚Äù, so they can at least understand the importance of the guild/WG and know what to expect.



## 2. Collect feedback



Conduct surveys ( Here is an example of what it could look like: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfs4hiYQn98UhZs91JTzWGXHKmLBnumMtfyi5jJTtzGimdVgQ/viewform ) or brief interviews with new / old members to gather their feedback and insights on the onboarding process, then tailor improvements based on their input.



## 3 . Use icebreaker activities and gamification elements



Develop structured icebreaker activities in your sessions to promote socializing among new and existing members.



Incorporate gamification elements (points, scores, leaderboards) into the onboarding process to increase engagement and make it more enjoyable for new members.



## 4. Showcase your group‚Äôs activities



Provide examples of past projects or collaborative efforts to showcase the WG‚Äôs activities and accomplishments. This will be helpful for those who want to try the ‚Äú **learning by doing** ‚Äù approach to contributing to a WG.



In particular, it is important to help new people to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù with what the workgroup has done before they joined, especially in relation to tasks that are still ongoing. This will mean that they are able to join in with tasks that started before they arrived. This ‚Äúcatching people up‚Äù could be done in a meeting; or in a one-to-one conversation with a mentor (see the next item, on mentorship!)



## 5 . Offer mentorship



Assign a mentor, or some kind of **support,** to guide new members through their involvement and help them navigate the group's processes and resources. (NOTE: WGs can budget for this, and pay people who do significant amounts of mentoring) .  We believe this would take out the main issue of people being unable to access a WG Lead, or understand how things work.



Have a person assigned to offer support for each core activity the WG does ( a ‚Äú go-to‚Äù person to make things easier for newbies or people who are yet to feel fully onboarded). This is particularly important in relation to tasks that are already in progr ess when a new person joins, so that they can get involved.



Implement a **buddy** system - a support structure where new or less-experienced members are paired with a more experienced or seasoned partner to provide guidance and support, particularly during their initial meetings.



## 6. Develop context-setting materials

****

Draft better documentation (a step-by-step, literallyü´†) on how to do some recurring tasks; and a Q&A doc. This would help newcomers get involved quickly, do their first task & build from there.



O ffer resources or materials (e.g. style guides, glossaries) to assist new members in their tasks and familiarize them with the group's workflow.



## 7. Provide an overview of the Ambassador Program



Provide background information or resources for new members, to help them gain a better understanding of the WG 's role in governance and decision-making processes in the SNET Ambassador program.



## 8. Use inclusive decision-making strategies



Try as much as possible to include everyone in your decision-making process. We've had comments from people on how left out they feel if decisions are made without consulting every member of the WG.



For example , if you are creating a quarterly budget for your WG, give way for comments and additions on it. This will make anyone understand that they have a say in the workings of any WG they are a part of.



## 9. Offer training sessions



Offer training or orientation sessions for new members, to familiarize them with the group's practices, tools (e.g. Github, Meeting summary tool, etc.), and platforms.



A video on this, that stays (preferably pinned) in the group‚Äôs open Discord channel or Github, will come in handy .



## 10. Encourage participation



Encourage new members to ask questions and seek clarification during meetings to ensure they feel comfortable and informed about the group's operations. Also, make time to ask ‚ÄúAre there any questions?‚Äù frequently in meetings.



Also, ensure that you offer some entry-level tasks - things that new people can do without needing to have a great deal of knowledge about the WorkGroup. This will enable them to start participating straight away.



## 11. Create some membership and contribution guidelines



When welcoming new people, p rovide details on what your WG/Guild does. Particularly, explain what skills and knowledge someone can use or learn there.



Give guidelines on how to do key tasks, how to join, who to contact, who else to contact if the main contact is too busy to get back to you, how to get assigned a task, how you get (or take) responsibility, what kinds of contributions **‚Äúcount‚Äù** and are tracked, and what kinds are not, etc.



Maybe also try pinning in your Discord channel a clear  statement on how someone becomes a **‚Äúmember‚Äù** of the

WG/Guild - or, if there is no formal membership as such, state that clearly - and a list of current members.



## 12. Acknowledge people for their work, and thank them!



WGs/Guilds should pay attention to helping people know they‚Äôre contributing, and they‚Äôre **valued** , and seen.
