# Onboarding WG quarterly report:

Quarter 1 2024, 1st Jan to 31st March



# This Quarter, we undertook the following:

### Regular meetings, membership, documentation

We continued to ho ld regular meetings  once a week. Naturally, attendance has varied from week to week, but we have gained 5 new members this Quarter.

We drafted a roster for the facilitation and documentation of meetings while supporting new workgroup members who offered to give it a try.





**Events**

On 8th Feb. 2024, we held an Onboarding session for new people, here is the link to the onboarding session slides made available to everyone .

### Budgeting and Rewarding Processes

We engaged our new and old members in discussing budget (For example, quarterly budget, rewards for each task in and outside the WG), and onboarded them to attend Treasury Guild meetings on behalf of the group, fostering greater awareness and understanding of program-wide budget issues.

### Discord #GettingStarted

We keep sustaining the #GettingStarted channel in Discord, and a Getting Started doc where people can make suggestions; and we have implemented changes suggested by community members.

We are working towards adding a note on MINs as it is currently being used to track contributions in the ambassador program .

We teamed up with a member of the Video WG to create a new Welcome video for the Ambassador program: Here is the link .

We created a video with a voice-over on the last onboarding session slides, here is the link .

### Continuous Onboarding Research

We finalised our continuous onboarding session, here is the report .

We also created a document on potential tools that could be utilized to enhance continuous onboarding in different WGs.

### One-to-one Engagement

We have continued to offer lots of direct 1-2-1 support to new people via DM. We noted evidently that this personal approach appears to be really significant in helping people feel like they are a part of SNET and the SNET Ambassador program.

We continue to email potential new Ambassadors, and open a channel of communication with them.

### Collaboration

This quarter we have encouraged teamwork between WG members on tasks to foster growth, brainstorming of ideas, and support.

The secondary reason is the fact that some of the work we do can not be done by one person.

We have also teamed up with Gamers Guild to test out their Roblox Game.







# Key statistics

Average attendance at meetings: 7

Facilitation of meetings and onboarding sessions have been done by Sucre, Vani, Love, Onyeka, and Peter. Documentation of meeting proceedings has been done by  Vani, CJ Frankie, Love, and Onyeka.

A total of 9 Gimbals and 16,670 MINS were earned by 39 contributors this quarter.

Tasks and rewards  have been distributed among all active members.

Out of a Q1 budget of 12265 AGIX , we spent 5884 AGIX . Note that the comparatively low spend is mainly due to the sharp uptick in the price of AGIX during this quarter, rather than to an overestimate of what budget we would need.

The remainder of 6381 AGIX will be kept in the Treasury reserve.

# Comments from WG MembersðŸŒŸ

It's been an interesting quarter! I got to take on tasks I never thought I could handle, everyone was welcoming, funny, contributive, and pleasant!ðŸ«¢

This quarter, I love that we've been quite ambitious - we've conducted some proper research about how onboarding happens in the Program, which makes everyone's perspective on this more evidence-based. It's also meant we've been very outward-looking, and collaborated with other WGs. It's also been brilliant to see new people coming into the WG, and taking a turn at things like facilitating and documenting.

It has been a quarter full of growth, learning and collaboration. Iâ€™m glad that the workgroup pioneers a lot of things used in the ambassador program and is always open to collabs with other workgroups

The onboarding WG has the best welcoming experience; Iâ€™d say theyâ€™re the most receptive WG Iâ€™ve seen so far. What a quarter it has been - from writing my first meeting summary to learning how to use the summary tool to making infographics and all, this WG has left a lasting impact in my heart. Thanks to Sucre, Vani, Onyeka, and Love. More milestones ahead!

There is a joy I get when I hear other Workgroups speak on our coordination and our ability to deliver results. Before, many didn't see the importance of an Onboarding Workgroup but now I can say it's very clear on the eyes of many that the onboarding workgroup is a key part of the Ambassador program, we have had new active members in this quarter like Duke, slate and so on, our retention rate has been superb, I think the big thanks need to go to Sucre, Vani, Love for taking this work group on this amazing journey, through your Dedication, Coordination, Hospitality in making sure new members feel at home and welcomed into the program but I believe this is just the beginning and a lot is yet to come from us.



# Our plans for Q2 2024 include:

We will create a monthly bounty task with a reward for one member to keep WG members aware of what different WGs in the Ambassador program are doing, and signpost new people on Discord to the right WG for them.

We plan to deliver one Onboarding session for newcomers by May 2024.

We plan to have a treasury session with Andre on the 18th of April.

We want to develop some context-setting / educational material about any issues that the community is making decisions on, before the decision is made, to help new people get to grips with the issue - in collaboration with R&D Guild or Education Guild or both.

We will maintain the Onboarding Session slides, keeping them updated to reflect any changes to the Program; and weâ€™ll make them widely available for anyone who wants to use them to publicise the Ambassador program.

We will continue to maintain the #GettingStarted channel in Discord, keeping it updated with any changes.

We will encourage more members to try out documentation, facilitation and report writing as we have seen that these are some of the skills they can learn in this workgroup and use elsewhere.
