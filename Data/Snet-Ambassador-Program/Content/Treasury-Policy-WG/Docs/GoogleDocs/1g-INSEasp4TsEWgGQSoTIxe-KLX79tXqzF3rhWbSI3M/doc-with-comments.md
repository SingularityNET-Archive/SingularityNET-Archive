# Treasury Policy Template



## Introduction

This document should be a living document to capture guiding material for

Creating Policies

What is the minimum required information needed to submit a Policy?

How are policies managed?

Capturing insights from different Ambassador Program core members.

How have they been able to adopt policies and guidelines?



### History

For the p ast 2 years, the Ambassador Program has used emergent strategies to come up with rules and guiding materials. Our information is shared through our social channels and meeting summaries.

Some made rules and guidelines are consolidated into documents or GitBook but get outdated quickly. For example here is a 2022 Miro Board https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMG1pF_g=/

## What have been our current processes? (to adopt the above policies)

## Guiding Questions:

How



## Insights:

**Insights from Tevo from Treasury Guild perspective**

We have had no issues adopting the policies and rules for Treasury Guild.

It requires focused time from at least one member in team to draft documents and further updates usually are taken over by rest of the interested people.



Most of the guidelines and requirements only express what we have said out loud and what we know, but usually havent written down.

Adopting processes and rules suggested by others has improved clarity on work that has been done and made us realise what is our capacity.

## How new policies will be ratified and moved into effect?

The process is yet to be fully fleshed out however the initial plan is as follows:

Submit Policy via Google Form

Policy Selectors will Review Policies and suggest policies to be investigated further

Selected Policy will now be reviewed by everyone who is interested via Policy Feedback Google Form

Treasury Guild sessions are used to discuss if Policy should be moved for ratification

Policy selected for ratification will go trough Consent Google Form

If there is no blockers the policy will take effect based on the implentation start time





## Mandatory Policy Minimum Requirements

**Rule** - A clear and concise statement outlining the specific requirement or guideline that must be adhered to within the policy. This rule defines what is mandatory and sets the standard for compliance.

****

**Problem Policy Addresses** - A description of the specific issue or challenge that the policy is designed to resolve. This section explains why the policy is necessary and what it aims to achieve in terms of improving operations, compliance, safety, or other relevant areas.



**Implementation Start Time** - The designated date and time when the mandatory policy will begin to be enforced. This provides a clear timeline for preparation and ensures that all stakeholders are aware of when compliance is expected to start.



**Rule Activation Dependencies** - Specific conditions or additional rules that influence how the main rule is applied. These dependencies detail the circumstances under which the main rule is modified or applied differently.



**Hypothesis** - An educated assumption about the expected outcomes of implementing the policy. This hypothesis outlines the anticipated benefits, improvements, or changes that will result from enforcing the policy, providing a basis for evaluating its effectiveness over time.

## Example Policy

**Rule -** Once per month each Workgroup/guild organisers will be rewarded 100 USD in AGIX when 10+ people join their workgroup 

> [Comments]
> Context - Once per month each Workgroup/guild organisers will be rewarded 100 USD in AGIX when 10+ people join their workgroup
> * Vanessa Cardui: We seem to have process whereby a policy can be tweaked or iterated on (see below) - but not process for how people can say "This is actually a bad idea".

For example, with this one, someone might argue this is a bad idea because sheer numbers isn't in itself something we want to reward, but *meaningful* engagement.
How would they do that?
>



**Problem Policy Addresses -** Faciliating medium groups is not being recognized.

****

**Implementation Start Time -** Policy enforcement begins on July 1, 2024.

****

**Rule Activation Dependencies -** If the organizer has already received more than 2000 AGIX this month the bonus rewards will be reduced by 50% and kept in the treasury.



**Hypothesis -** The policy will encourage more organizers to participate by ensuring by adding a fun element and looking ahead to prevent excessive payouts. Splitting funds ensures fair distribution of bonus rewards among organizers.

****

****

## Another Policy Example that builds on first one but gives also different idea into how policies can affect eachother

**Rule** - In certain conditions whenever bonus rewards are split between group and rewards are kept in the treasury or moved back there the rewards instead will be distributed between the other members in the group.



**Problem Policy Addresses** - Policies that incentivise groups, but incentives get pushed back due to dependencies fail to recognize training sessions.



**Implementation Start Time** - Policy enforcement begins on July 2, 2024.



**Activation Dependencies** - The member has to be recongised as onboardee. The rewarded member can not exceed more than 2000 AGIX income per month. In case these rewards are instead the remaining members. If all members exceed or reach 2000 AGIX limit, then the rewards will stain in Treasury Guild.



**Hypothesis** - This policy will enhance the overall engagement within workgroups by distributing the rewards among other members, it will encourage active training sessions.
