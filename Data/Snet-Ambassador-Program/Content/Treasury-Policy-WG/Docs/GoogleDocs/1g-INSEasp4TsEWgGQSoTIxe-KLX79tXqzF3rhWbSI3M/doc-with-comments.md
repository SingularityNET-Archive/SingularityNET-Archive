# Treasury Policy Template



## Introduction

This document should be a living document to capture guiding material for

Creating Policies

What is the minimum required information to submit a policy?

How are policies managed?

How are policies prioritized?

How are policies rewarded?

Capturing insights from different Ambassador Program core members.

How have they been able to adopt policies and guidelines?



### History

For the p ast 2 years, the Ambassador Program has used emergent strategies to come up with rules and guiding materials. Our information is shared through our social channels and meeting summaries.

Some made rules and guidelines are consolidated into documents or GitBook but get outdated quickly. For example here is a 2022 Miro Board https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMG1pF_g=/



## What are our current policies?

You can find the submitted policies here

## What have been our current processes? (to adopt the above policies)

## Guiding Questions:

Is someone on the team trying to adopt new policies and integrate them into group processes?

Have you been in the training or discussion calls that explain how to adopt new rules or guidelines?

How are policy changes communicated in group and how they have been received?

What impact has it had on your workgroups when adopting new policies, templates or guidelines?

## Insights:

**Insights from Tevo from Treasury Guild perspective**

We have had no issues adopting the policies and rules for Treasury Guild.

It requires focused time from at least one member in team to draft documents and further updates usually are taken over by rest of the interested people.



Most of the guidelines and requirements only express what we have said out loud and what we know, but usually havent written down.

Adopting processes and rules suggested by others has improved clarity on work that has been done and made us realise what is our capacity.



**Insights from Peter as a Core Contributor perspective**

If rules get implemented people are aware of the guidelines and rules but as time goes on the documentation is in different places and rules are forgbotten.

There is a lot of meeting Updates that have a lot of decision items. Not all decision affect all workgroups.



**Insights from Ayo as Core Contributor perspective**

I became aware of policies if they affected me directly or if I had to interact with policy.

Would expect a quarterly infographic to learn existing and new policies.

Intepreting Policy can differ from based on person who reads it.

I understand that Policies are meant to protect Ambassador Program and make it sustainable.



**Insights from Daniel from Startegy Guild**

Wasn’t also aware of policies that affected Strategy Guild. Internally this information was shared until tension was raised about issues. Knowledge Base WG has NO items about roadmap and this might be issue that new members don’t know how do we progress from month to month or even quarter to quarter in general in the Ambassador program.



**Insights from Yemi as New Member**

When you take up activities you come across with policies. I would say there is a lot of information, personally I feel like doing tasks and learning step by step.







## How new policies will be ratified and moved into effect?

The process is yet to be fully fleshed out however the initial plan is as follows:

Read Treasury Policy Template

Submit Policy via Google Form

Within 1 week the selected policy should be announced to all Core Contributors

Review Submitted Polcies via Google Form

Policy Selectors will Review Policies and suggest policies to be investigated further

Treasury Guild sessions are used to discuss if Policy should be moved for ratification

Within 2 weeks after announcing submission policies only have positive reviews agenda item should be picked up if possible.

Policy selected for ratification will go trough Consent Google Form

If there is no blockers the policy will take effect based on the implentation start time







## Mandatory Policy Minimum Requirements

**Policy Name** - Name to recognize Policy easily

****

**Rule** - A clear and concise statement outlining the specific requirement or guideline that must be adhered to within the policy. This rule defines what is mandatory and sets the standard for compliance.

****

**Problem Policy Addresses** - A description of the specific issue or challenge that the policy is designed to resolve. This section explains why the policy is necessary and what it aims to achieve in terms of improving operations, compliance, safety, or other relevant areas.



**Implementation Start Time** - The designated date and time when the mandatory policy will begin to be enforced. This provides a clear timeline for preparation and ensures that all stakeholders are aware of when compliance is expected to start.



**Implementation End Time** - When policy will end to check back again assess the effect of the policy. Considering the first ratification more of an experimentation.



**Rule Activation Dependencies** - Specific conditions or additional rules that influence how the main rule is applied. These dependencies detail the circumstances under which the main rule is modified or applied differently.



**Hypothesis** - An educated assumption about the expected outcomes of implementing the policy. This hypothesis outlines the anticipated benefits, improvements, or changes that will result from enforcing the policy, providing a basis for evaluating its effectiveness over time.

## Example Policy

**Rule -** Once per month each Workgroup/guild organisers will be rewarded 100 USD in AGIX when 10+ people join their workgroup

> * Vanessa Cardui: We seem to have process whereby a policy can be tweaked or iterated on (see below) - but not process for how people can say "This is actually a bad idea".

For example, with this one, someone might argue this is a bad idea because sheer numbers isn't in itself something we want to reward, but *meaningful* engagement.
How would they do that?

**Problem Policy Addresses -** Faciliating medium groups is not being recognized.

****

**Implementation Start Time -** Policy enforcement begins on July 1, 2024.

****

**Rule Activation Dependencies -** If the organizer has already received more than 2000 AGIX this month the bonus rewards will be reduced by 50% and kept in the treasury.



**Hypothesis -** The policy will encourage more organizers to participate by ensuring by adding a fun element and looking ahead to prevent excessive payouts. Splitting funds ensures fair distribution of bonus rewards among organizers.

****

****

## Another Policy Example that builds on the first one but also gives a different idea of how policies can affect each other

**Rule** - In certain conditions whenever bonus rewards are split between group and rewards are kept in the treasury or moved back there the rewards instead will be distributed between the other members in the group.



**Problem Policy Addresses** - Policies that incentivise groups, but incentives get pushed back due to dependencies fail to recognize training sessions.



**Implementation Start Time** - Policy enforcement begins on July 2, 2024.



**Activation Dependencies** - The member has to be recongised as onboardee. The rewarded member can not exceed more than 2000 AGIX income per month. In case these rewards are instead the remaining members. If all members exceed or reach 2000 AGIX limit, then the rewards will stain in the Treasury Guild.



**Hypothesis** - This policy will enhance the overall engagement within workgroups by distributing the rewards among other members, it will encourage active training sessions.



## How are policies prioritized?

Monthly Limits

We select 5 policies per month to review.



If there are more policies we start with those that have less than 3 policies submitted.

If the amount of policies still exceeds the amount that takes time to review, we continue to filter down by the policy amount per person.



If more than 5 different people submitted a single policy, we will do some async quick checks and sentiment analysis.



## How the Policies are rewarded?

Policies are valid

Is related to treasury

Is not in place already

Is not a duplicate

How similar is it to existing previous rules?

Monthly Limits

The maximum reward per person is 20 USD in AGIX.

The maximum reward per policy is 10 USD in AGIX.



When more than 5 policies are submitted in a given month, the reward distribution follows a dynamic calculation. Each submitter receives a share of the total reward pool proportional to their percentage of total submissions. This method ensures that rewards are allocated fairly based on the contribution of each submitter.



Example from ChatGPT how dynamic rewards would look like if there were 3 people and a total of 10 submissions:
