#### Context - George Bernard Shaw once said, &quot;Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.&quot;

The quote stresses that progress cannot be achieved on its own unless there is some form of change. We&#39;re in danger of stagnation and hindering any future growth or improvement without a willingness to alter our thinking, beliefs, as well as approaches. Progress means forward movement, a shift from the current state to an advanced or advantageous one and it requires the willingness to embrace change
