#### Context - SingularityNET Merchandise (Tops/Caps)
> * Frank Chukwurah: I was thinking of something: can we take this to another dimension by creating our own “online store?" It can create a sense of connection and belonging among community members, as they can proudly wear and use branded merchandise. 


In the realm of revenues:The SNET online store can generate revenue that supports the DAO’s initiatives, events, and operational costs. 


More so, it can serve as a “word-of-mouth marketing campaign.” As community members utilise and showcase this merchandise at home, offices, and schools, it can serve as organic marketing, spreading awareness about the DAO.
>   - Frank Chukwurah: Additionally, what if we design stunning t-shirts and hoodies etc and make them the ideal outfit for any physical community gathering - community members will need to purchase them for any upcoming events.
