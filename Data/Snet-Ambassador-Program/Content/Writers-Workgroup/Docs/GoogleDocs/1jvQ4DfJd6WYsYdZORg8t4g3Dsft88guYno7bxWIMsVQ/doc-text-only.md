## Onboarding

Onboarding is simple and currently open at the Writer’s workgroup and is completed upon successfully taking the Writers Workgroup test which gives the successful applicant a discord tag “Scribbler” to enable access to the discord channel for communication and dework space for task management. Onboarding can happen anytime as long as the quota for each quarter is yet to be reached.



An editing framework is provided for applicants looking to take the Writers Workgroup test. It is not mandatory to read the framework but it’s advised as it can be a great tool moving forward for every scribbler.

## Roadmap

The Writer Workgroup is dedicated to enriching the SingularityNET Ambassador Program through written content creation and management. Something to look forward to would be the Twitter Spaces for special edition town halls and as a platform to engage community members directly and instantly as a momentum buildup for revamping the podcast project.
