#### Context - Application/Interest from Scribblers
> * Tevo Saks: Is there Application Form?
>   - kenichi: still working on this, i'll be sharing a sample draft i have with the WG today on the call, i'll add it to a form when thats agreed on
>   - Tevo Saks: For simplicity what your proposal is missing is all these things you actually don't have, which could be well-defined deliverables.
>   - Tevo Saks: I will include it to the Proposal

#### Context - Yet to get scribbler tag/lost scribbler tag due to inactivity
> * Mikasa Williams: We have some inactive members
Or how long ofinactiveness is called in active
>   - kenichi: Once this document passes, anyone that doesn’t qualify using the Points System, would be affected by this
> 
#### Context - At least 2 meeting attendance each month
> * Mikasa Williams: I feel this should be 3… scribblers are prospect scribes
Their attendance is a major play
>   - kenichi: yes but this is just the minimum so they don't lose the tag. if they want to become a scribe they would have to do more than the minimum
> 
#### Context - Has to do research and pitch article ideas
> * Love Owokere: I feel like this should be for scribblers. It is too much responsibility for a pupil.
>   - kenichi: Thats the whole idea. So they get used to it and keep doing it when they become scribblers
>   - kenichi: This way they can start showing commitment
>   - Rejoice Olie: Hi Kenichi, I am interested in being part of the group, how can I become a pupil? I can delete this if it shouldn't be here.
