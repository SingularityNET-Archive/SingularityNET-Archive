The most stable version is available but itâ€™s currently in development so there might be need of **continuous developer support** even to make some minor changes

**Increased Cost** for development as compared to other platforms.

**Absence of testing mechanism and online classes.**

**Transaction cost for each mint by the learner**

**Lack of documentation for Developing new Courses**
