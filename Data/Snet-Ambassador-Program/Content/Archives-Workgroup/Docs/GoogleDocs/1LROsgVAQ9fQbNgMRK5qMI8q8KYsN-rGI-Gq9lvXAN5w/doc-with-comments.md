# Snet Archive AI Features





**Automatically categorise and tag archival content** to facilitate navigation and organisation.



Notes - This would be about APPLYING tags, not defining them - the tag taxonomy itself is better if it’s human-made. We’re interested in experimenting to see how well it works to ask an AI to apply human-defined tags to a corpus.





**Implement sentiment analysis**  to provide insights into the emotional tone of the contents.



Notes - We’d want this to be based on linguistic analysis, rather than some kind of scoring. How far can an AI identify sentiment from something relatively dry like a meeting summary?





**Dashboard to provide** statistical insights, trends, and visualisations derived from the archive data.

Notes **-** We’re interested in quite ambitious things with this kind of database and statistics.

Could it draw data from more than 1 source within the corpus?For example: could it look at how many meetings Person A has been to that week, and plot that against how many action items they've got assigned to them that week? (revealing who is just showing up, and who's volunteering to do work?) Maybe add also - how new is Person A? Can we see how long they are involved before they start picking up tasks?

Or a gentler example: how many decisions have been made about xyz this month, and break it down to how many of them came from which WG? so we can see which WGs are actively concerned with this or that…

This would be an experiment into what an AI can infer - or whether it can infer at all? Can it take 2 pieces of data and make an inference about what they mean in combination? Can it actually suggest pieces of archival data that could be combined to reveal meaning? And if it can, how much of its ability to infer would have to stem from explicit training? AND - is all this applicable to things like reputation systems?What is the meaning of this or that combination of data to our community?
