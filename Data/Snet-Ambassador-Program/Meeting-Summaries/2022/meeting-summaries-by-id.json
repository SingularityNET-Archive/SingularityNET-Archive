In this experiment, proposers can present their ideas to the community for funding. The purpose is to clarify what a proposal is and is not about, so the community can make informed decisions when voting. The first proposal discussed is about using expert ratings to assess proposals. This would help the community make better funding decisions by considering technical feasibility, viability based on budget and team, and desirability or market need. There are challenges in finding and incentivizing experts, but this could be a valuable addition in the future. The second proposal is about funding existing services to be onboarded to the SingularityNET marketplace. This could be a faster and more impactful way to grow the marketplace. The community could participate by finding services, onboarding them, and even splitting rewards. The third proposal is about the award value and whether to use fiat or token value. There are pros and cons to both approaches. Using fiat protects teams from token price fluctuations, but using tokens aligns with SingularityNET's goals. The proposal explores options like a minimum token price or a mix of fiat and tokens. The discussion highlights the importance of balancing risks and rewards for both the community and the teams. The meeting concludes with the idea that the community will vote on the proposals.",

          "townHallSummary": "Kevin Chen presenting two governance proposals regarding SingularityNET's platform integration support for deep funding projects and voter eligibility in funding rounds. Important points are  Platform Integration Support Proposal: Kevin proposes offering support for integrating deep funding projects into the SingularityNET Marketplace. He highlights concerns about the complexity of current integration processes and suggests creating support networks or expert groups to assist with seamless deployment. Discussion expands to potentially involving the community in onboarding processes, aligning with another proposal from Peter.  Voter Eligibility Proposal: Kevin raises questions about voter eligibility in funding rounds, particularly whether proposers should be allowed to vote for their own projects. Concerns are discussed regarding the fairness and potential biases when proposers vote for their own projects. Suggestions include tracking voting behavior to identify and possibly discount or weight votes based on historical patterns or community engagement levels. Community   Engagement and Reputation Systems: There's a proposal to link voting weight with community engagement on the platform. Ideas include rewarding active engagement with higher voting weights and possibly integrating reputation systems visible on user profiles to encourage constructive participation. The discussion touches on potential issues like manipulation of votes and the need for mechanisms to adjust and reset such systems over time.  Long-Term Governance Considerations: Participants emphasize the importance of designing governance systems that can evolve and adapt over time without becoming locked into problematic structures. There's a preference for systems that allow adjustments based on community behavior and feedback rather than rigid rules.   In summary, the conversation delves into improving platform accessibility for deep funding projects, ensuring fair voting practices, and exploring ways to integrate community engagement and reputation into governance processes. The focus is on flexibility, transparency, and community involvement in shaping SingularityNET's governance framework.",

As outlined before the start of this process, we have filtered all submissions and ideas down to 3 questions. These are, however, not the only things we will change.  We are at the early stages of Deep Funding, and it would be impractical and overwhelming to submit all possible options for change to the community. Moreover, the process of decentralized decision-making is still in its infancy, and more experience (and community engagement!) is needed to ensure that the outcomes are aligned with the majority of the community and best interests of the Deep Funding program."

One proposal is to create a pool of rewards for onboarding existing AI services to the Singularity platform.

Cardano Summit and Deep Funding Round Two: The host provided a brief overview of the new rules and conditions for Deep Funding Round Two, noting that a more detailed discussion would be scheduled later due to the complexity of the document.  2. Singularity Net Initiative: A proposed training program for community members was discussed, aimed at helping teams onboard and get paid for their contributions. This initiative would require significant effort but offers substantial rewards.  3. Onboarding Process: The meeting highlighted challenges with the current onboarding process, including confusion over documentation and the navigation between the developer and publisher portals. Suggestions were made to improve clarity and user experience, such as providing an overview of the steps and requirements upfront.  4. Video Tutorials: The team is working on creating video tutorials to help with onboarding, addressing a previous request from a community member.  5. Onboarding as a Service: There was a proposal to offer onboarding as a service, potentially creating job opportunities for community developers to assist in the process. This could include formal training and credentialing for those involved.  6. Market Conditions and Deep Funding Treasury Protection: Concerns were raised about the current market conditions and the need to protect the Deep Funding treasury from significant downturns. A minimum exchange rate will be established to safeguard the funds.  The meeting concluded with an emphasis on the importance of community feedback and collaboration to improve the onboarding process and the overall success of the initiatives discussed.",
