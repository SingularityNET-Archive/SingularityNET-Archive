Providing services according to the needs and the timelines of other groups, while tapping into their budgets, is best delivered by a separate unit, perhaps a financially self-sufficient Workgroup.

There was discussion on ways to assign Scribblers to the Substack newsletter task.\n\nOnboarding new members: Precious was given introduction into the workgroup, and the test was also shared.

We track tasks, not time - the task is what matters, not the time it takes a particular person to do it. Focusing on \"time\" can distort assessments of contribution, force inappropriate assumptions about work and its value, obscure some types of work (e.g. \"micro-engagements\" too small to be recorded as \"time spent\", but which mount up over a month) and overvalue other types (e.g. sitting passively in meetings). Currently, we provide a spreadsheet export of our GitHub Issues Board to track contribution, and we don't use Dework. There may be other ways to add our data to the Treasury system via the metadata of a fund request? But we have a diferent philosophy of what constitutes \"contribution\" than some other workgroups; and the Dework-based, hourly-rate approach doesn't fit it. Maybe different workgroups should each decide what counts as \"contribution\" for them; not piecemenal \"assessment\" but a more overall sense of what someone is contributing",

This led to a discussion about how the ecosystem could apply ethics and safety. This could take the form of local groups set within a broader, ecosystemwide ethics committee, so that there's coherence but also focused attention within groups, and freedom to do it according to their needs. Some ethics needs will be different.\n\nWe talked about how the Global Ethics Initiative fits in the Risk Management Framework. Specifically, gathering information from ecosystem groups, and collating general ethics research and information. It was suggested that setting standards for the Marketplace could ensure that spinoffs apply it (thought that's only effective if they care about getting on the Marketplace). We agreed to set up a common resource spreadsheet to start to gather research information and frameworks.\n\n\nWe discussed how the LATAM ambassadors can get involved in the Global Ethics Initiative. They could translate survey into Spanish and distribute. Maybe the Foundation funding can contribute to that.\nAmbassadors could have a presence at AI for Good and/or AGI and continue the fishbowl interviews (discussed proper ethics and informed consent form, and collecting metadata/contextual data",

        "narrative": "AI Ethics Strategy drafting: \nwe discussed whether it would be a better idea to have a mix of experts and non-experts to collaborate on drafting the 3 strategies we want to complete. We noted that we have no proof of people's self-rated skill/knowledge level - but we agreed that it's fine, in this instance, to trust people on what they say about themselves. We discussed having 2 teams for each strategy - one for \"writing\" (3 people) and one for \"review/edit\" (2 people), and we suggested people should only sign up for one thing, to ensure that the work is shared out fairly between people. Ayo suggested min/max \"points\" level for each task - 24 for writing team and 12 for edit team -  (based on people's 1 to 10 \"how skilled are you\" self-rating), to ensure we get a reasonable level of expertise. Given the number of people interested, we have under-budgeted for this initiative; but we agreed we could move a bit of budget from another budget-line which we are unlikely to fully use, e.g. \"Communication management & community outreach\". \n\nCo-chair\nWe discussed if having a co-chair (a channel of communication between the AI Ethics WG and the Foundation's Global Ethics Initiative) is a good idea. The AI Ethics WG idea did come from them. Some of us feel we should try it and if it's not a great idea then we can shut it down. We will see what people think about it at the repeat meeting for other timezones on Wednesday. We created a signup space for those who have already done Q2 work on this, in page 2 of https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vLC4ZIHO3WN-Ah9XwehRmbwLZAeePsxxYQXmLiiJLnQ/edit?usp=sharing\n\nWorkgroup membership:\nWe agreed that we DO want some kind of membership and a Discord tag, but we agreed that we will raise this at Wednesday's meeting and see if people have ideas on how to decide who is a member. We mentioned that meeting attendance isn't necessarily the same as participation, you can be quite passive in a meeting. We were unsure how to measure contribution: MINS tokens were suggested but not everyone agreed.\n\nQ3 WG Budget: \nWe need to submit a budget by 19th June. We will create an extra sheet on the planning spreadsheet where everyone can put in ideas for what we should do in Q3, and the budget that would be needed. The link will be shared on Discord.\n\nForum for Ethics discussion: \nIs it a great idea? People agreed that we should do it and that it should be open to all - but it needs to be specifically for discussion on ethics issues, not for workgroup organizational stuff. Moderators would be able to help enforce this - but we are not sure who CAN be a moderator, as it would give you moderator rights for the entire SNET discord server. LeeLoo, Duke, Gorga, and Clement are interested in being a moderator.\n\nFuture meeting:\nShould we meet again on the 24th and 26th of June for this quarter? We will see what people say about it on Wednesday and in Discord channel discussion.\n",

This led to a discussion on what logo would best fit the Spanish page. Following that, she also mentioned the need for a tweet sample from Mikasa that she could use as a template for writing content for the Spanish page.\n\nDiscussion and digging deep into the Q3 budget and projections. Kenichi opened the floor for suggestions and ideas will be welcomed with open arms.\n\nToday's meeting also navigated the axis of our substack newsletter and how articles will be published in the future.\n\nWe talked about our monthly newsletter; even though we aim to reach more people via email, we want individuals to choose whether they want to receive our emails so we don't clutter their inboxes.\n\nWe discussed how the community page articles will be paid for - it was suggested that drafts will be rewarded based on word count and performance. Any article that performs well over time will be rewarded from the points system allocation.\n\nLady Tempestt asks Kenichi about the Cogito articles from last year and the reward status, and then Kenichi says he'll reach out to Sandra.\n\nOn the other hand, Ayo spoke about the WWG onboarding process - he suggested that the WG could have an automated, seamless and faster onboarding process rather than leveraging human power. \n\nWe addressed how many people can get onboarded in a quarter! Since Ines raised questions like (will there be work for new people who are joining the WWG newly?). Ines suggests that we do onboarding at the end of each quarter to help us prepare future budgets and allocation to reward all contributions without having a second thought.\n\n",

He also stated that the form will help track new people coming to the WG and if they decide to become scribblers in the future. \n\nKenichi proposed the idea of tracking meeting matrices since read.ai doesn't track data such as attendance or the time people joined a meeting. Then he also emphasized  the importance of these data and how they will help in the WG in the future.\n\nFollowing that, he also proposed the idea of points delegations, where the scribblers and the scribes will be awarded an extra 10 points from the points system. These points can be delegated to other members of the workgroup to show love and support for their contributions towards your task(s), or whatever the case might be! \n\nWe also addressed and answered questions regarding the aspirants who took the WG test.\n\nLady Tempestt proposed the idea of implementing a rotational meeting facilitation system in the WWG, and then Kenichi cleared the air by saying that the scribes could facilitate meetings in his absence.\n\nDiscussion on dropping off inactive members with the scribbler tag; this discussion set the Thames on fire. As we fleshed out the tests of the aspiring writers, we desire to give room for new scribblers to join us, explore the world of AI, and also tell captivating stories through writing.\n",

We're almost done with the MVP. Obviously, you can see the code from the from the repos on the on our common GitHub. I think once the MVP is ready, we can open source the code. We're going through some testings for the UI. We have very minimal backend functionalities for now, just because there wasn't enough time to have a lot of the functionalities that we predicted. But still, there is something to be tested and something to be improved. I expect it to be open source in the next week and a half, depending on how fast I will get well. But it should be done very soon. After that, we will be doing some testing with other workgroup members. And I guess the reporting on that would be part of Q3, not Q2. So Q2 was mainly about getting an MVP out.\"   Ubio gave updates on his reasearch; \"what we did was simply to convert responses we got from Q1 into Figma. In Q2, We converted the responses and the things we could derive from those response into a design.  Prototype design.  so that's what we did for Q2.

        "narrative": "AI Ethics Strategy drafting: \nLeeloo introduced herself and got the meeting started with discussion on the Strategy-drafting tasks, making reference to key takeaways from the AI Ethics WG 10th June Meeting (see meeting notes).\n\nTevo asked if there was a time/hour requirement for the Strategy-drafting tasks: none has been set yet. \n\nThe “Shadow-Mentoring” approach of the workgroup: it is the intent that less-experienced members of this workgroup are able to shadow more skilled people. LeeLoo referenced that there was already some considerable consent for this in the Monday meeting. Several thumbs-up to this regard with no dissenting leanings.\n\nLeeloo emphasized that there was room for anyone who wanted, to suggest additions or changes to the AI Ethics Workgroup stuff! spreadsheet in this meeting.\n\nBefore the strategy-drafting teams start wirk, there will be an orientation meeting for them with the GEI team from the Foundation: date TBC\n\nThere were also no different opinions to the selection points system suggested on Mon 10th by Ayo for those to work on the Strategy-drafting tasks.\n\nGorga asked if the spreadsheet is definitive as to what roles anyone will play in the strategy drafting tasks. Leeloo explained that  it isn't.\n\nCo-chair role:\nGuillermo suggested there should be a contributions-based criteria for the selection. Leeloo responded that it was okay if Guillermo wanted to put his name in the AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!  because all the names got there on the basis of self-election. Leeloo outlined possible requirements and expectations of the co-chair. Duke and Clement added their names to the sheet, made their intentions known to be considered for the co-chair. There was some confusion here, since the signup sheet is actually to record who has done \"co-cahir\"-type work in quarter *two* of 2024 (April to June), but people are signing up to express interest for Quarter **three*.\n\nWorkgroup Membership\nthe meeting built on 10th June discussion. \nAyo suggested that meeting attendance could form a strong base for membership criteria. \n\nLeeLoo added that there may be instances where people contribute extensively asynchronously without attending the formal meetings. Ayo agreed with the addendum that it therefore falls on everyone to come up with hybrid all-encompassing membership criteria, and how they will be measured and applied. \n\nClement suggested a tiered membership.\n\nKenichi opined that core-membership should be based on technical contributions and to see if there could be more tiers than one. Core membership could be also goal orientated, which could solve both short term and long term concerns. Tags could also help. \n\nAyo suggested moving forward by adopting a simple two tier (first tier by intention, attendance and participation; second tier by proven, measured and accepted sync and or a-sync contributions). \n\nGuillermo pointed out that tasks or expected contributions are already stated in AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!  Leeloo redirected that the excel sheet did only cover for the specifics of strategy drafting. \n\nQ3 Budget\nThe draft budget (sheet 3 of AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!) seemed to agree with everyone present in the meeting. Ayo suggested that it may be nice if the budget catered for something Leeloo later described as the \"information and resource archive guide\" - budget for a person or system that guarantees that everyone can be informed of all the ethics workgroup uncovers or documents as milestones or research are made.\n\nPrivate forum for Ethics discussion:\nEveryone agreed that we should be a forum for ethics discussion. After contributions from Clement, Kenichi, Leeloo and Ayo, the general consensus was that the forum will be open so everyone can follow the conversations therein, but only the 2-tier ethics workgroup member will be able to speak/chat in the forum. \n\nGuillermo suggested that the discussion and consensus be subjected to further conversations in subsequent meetings.\n\nNext meeting\nShould we meet again on the 24th and 26th of June for this quarter? 24th was favoured.",

Group members will test it. If it is plutocratic (i.e. 1 token 1 vote) we will not use.\n- How to publicise it on socials?\n- A 1-pager has been written to outline what the GEI is and ensure people understand what they are naming. Guillermo will transdlate to Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\nAsia/Pacific Internet governance networks\n- Jenn is working with these - they have an initiative to learn about AI ethics. Can it be integrated with the GEI?\n- LeeLoo: education is a huge part of the GEI, but in the longer term. Current focus is on gathering the public's opinion. We can connect in a few months, when we move more towards education.\n\nScope of GEI survey\nClement: is it within sNET< or wider?\nHaley: It's for all voices, including those not in WEb3 groups.\nLeeLoo: I have a good grasp of marginalised communities that don't use much tech, and how to engage them.\n\nLicensing of materials collected from surveys and interviews\n - Agree Creative Commons all the way!\n - CC BY-NC sharealike preferred\n - Do we licence material to individual interviewees? Always best to licence to a person, not an organisation, since organisations change; but this could be fiddly to manage and a problem if people do not want to be named.\n- To be discussed further\n \n\n",

        "narrative": "The meeting began with technical issues being addressed and the meeting agenda being shared and made accessible to all team members. The team discussed the use of routine tools and resources such as Discord SNET server, Zoom, and Google Docs. Ayo suggested discussing the budget first due to time constraints and the relevance of the topic. The team discussed the quarterly budget, focusing on the Agix token prices and its impact on the budget.\n\nThey calculated the approximate value in dollars and compared it to the previous quarter's budget. The discussion revolved around the allocation of the budget across different workgroups and guilds. There was a focus on ensuring fair distribution and maximizing the value of the available budget, with concerns raised about excessive allocation to certain areas and the potential impact on the community.\n\nThe team discussed reducing hourly rates and increasing work hours to maintain the total budget at $30. There was a debate on the appropriate hourly rate and the amount of work required for different tasks, leading to a decision to continue the discussion asynchronously on Discord. Gavriel proposed compensating core contributors with $4,000 for 15 hours of strategy development and discussion, with each core member expected to contribute 5 hours.\n\nBilly suggested reducing the hours to 5 or 6 per week for three core members, and emphasized the need to learn and adjust as they go. Gavriel and others discussed the complexity of developing a knowledge management and dissemination strategy, emphasizing the need for strategic alignment across the community. There was a debate about the role of delegation and the overlap with the Knowledge Base workgroup.\n\nBilly and Gavriel addressed concerns about the budget. Ayo clarified the distinction between weekly meetings and workshops, and encouraged everyone to access the strategy budget proposal document for further discussion and input.",

He plans to integrate recommendations from the last meeting summary and aims to complete this by the next meeting.\n\nAyo to create Initiative and Contribution Framework Document.\nAyo emphasized that while the document framework has been established, the focus now shifts from creation to active contribution. Given its comprehensive nature involving multiple sections, Ayo stressed that completing it shouldn't fall solely on one person but should be a collective effort. He highlighted the importance of avoiding redundancy within the document, noting specific sections like onboarding influenced by Sucre n Spice's work and strategy linked to other aspects. Ayo underscored the need for initiative and widespread contribution, proposing a timeline dedicated to collaborative contributions to finalize the document efficiently.\n.\n\nDiscussion item: How do we get more African countries to join the guild and participate in the program? (take outs from suggestions of previous meeting - surveys, merchandise, virtual meets, physical workshops, etc).\n\nClement recapped the last meeting's takeaways, including conducting surveys and collaborating with other institutions to promote the guild and SingularityNet initiative. He requested input on potential partner organizations and announced that he will create a document for these recommendations in the second phase of research. Clement also reminded the guild to contribute resources to support individual projects that align with the guild's objectives.\n\nMarketing Initiatives for the Guild\nAyo and Clement discussed marketing initiatives for the Guild, including incentivizing quality people to join and creating a template for sourcing individuals from other African countries. Ayo proposed forming a team to work on clear-cut marketing initiatives. He suggested we can have a four person’s team for that.\nSo the team comes with a series of marketing initiatives for the next meeting that we all can deliberate on and decide how to move forward.\n\nBounty to upload our past meeting summaries\nClement  suggested uploading past meeting summaries to a summary tool developed by the archives group and proposed offering a bounty for volunteers interested in this task. Ayo and Issac volunteered to do that.\n\nAMA Session Update\n\nWe reviewed the successful AMA session, which engaged five countries, with active participation from Kenya, Cameroon, and Ghana, and established contact with Rwanda.\n Ayo highlighted the need for a larger budget due to the extensive effort involved, with team members dedicating over seven hours each. Contributions from Ese, Clement, Onizi, and Ayo were praised. Clement emphasized customizing innovations to fit African needs, such as developing an African-specific language model. Overall, the session achieved its goals of outreach and meaningful AI discussions for Africa.\n\nQ3 Budget Updates\n\nClement noted that recent token prices are unfavorable, necessitating budget adjustments. Sucre suggested postponing final Q3 budget decisions until the treasury clarifies the percentage cut on July 10th, which is expected to be between 23% and 30%. While waiting, Sucre recommended identifying items to potentially reduce. Clement agreed to keep the Q3 budget pending, and Ayo concurred, especially since many guild members were absent. Clement emphasized that swift consent from the first batch of guilds shows strong support for core initiatives, allowing for a focused and strategic budgeting approach essential for solidifying the African guild's structure.",

          "Updates on Zealy: Lordkizzy highlighted that he had separate calls with kenichi and Devon with the week and reached an agreement with the Writers WG as regards to the payment for the liaison role, Devon will be paid from the Writer's WG point system in Q3 but in Q4 there will be an allocation for the liaison role in the Video WG Budget. Kenichi is going to study the next two sprints to get the exact figure for the payment, so that we won't be over paying or under paying anyone. Second Lordkizzy indicated that Devon sent out 5 long videos and 5 shorts in the previous sprint to kenichi but only 3 long videos were created as quests, so going forward Lordkizzy has made emphasis on Devon completing the training and getting the editorial access to the Zealy platform.",
          "Discussion on Operations going forward: Lord kizzy suggested that we include new columns in our content sheet for Tiktok and Instagram links and Zealy Quest Creation. Lordkizzy highlighted that there is a need for more participation in meetings since that is the environment where most decisions are made, and going forward he would try to see if the Video WG could adopt the Treasury system for task assignments rather than assigning members that are not up to speed on the conversation and decisions made by the video WG ",
          "Discussion on Budget: Lordkizzy and slate indicated that some other work groups are yet to get consent and that we should wait for one more week before making decisions ",
          "Discussion on Quality Control: Malik suggested that we audit scripts before the video creation, zalfred suggested that we should rather make this a priority for members to give meaningful feedback while giving consent to videos. Malik also highlighted that the majority of members rarely consent to videos and asked how that can be improved. Lordkizzy suggested provisions of incentives($5) for meaningful feedback to members on scripts and videos, that way we would get enough feedback on video and ensure that the Quality of videos are controlled. This will be implemented in Q4.",

        "narrative": "Attendee Count: 19 unique individuals, 20 devices.\n\nMeeting Narrative:\n\nMembership Criteria: Vani referenced the previous meeting - people do want membership, and a 2 tier system has been suggested but not yet agreed, and [7:33] mentioned her impression that hierarchical membership structures appeal to some, but not all. LadyTempestt [9:20] agreed with keeping it simple, and starting by giving tag to people who have attend meetings. Aetherblade suggested in Chat that there's a difference between people who look and people who contribute. Vani suggested [9:47] instead of meeting attendance, use contribution/posting in Discord, since it's hard to find a meeting time that everyone can do, but Discord posting can be in own time. After mention of several options, consent (no objections) to giving tag to anyone who comments in the WG Discord, and reassess later if we find we need tiers. Soundwaves confirmed that adding the tag to those active in Discord can be automated using the ME6 bot that we already have [9:20].\n\nStrategy-drafting: [11:47] the 3 writers and 2 editors for each strategy have all confirmed (see AI Ethics Workgroup stuff! spreadsheet). There will be an orientation meeting with Esther and Haley for each team, to define scope and discuss content; then teams will self-organise. Completion dates: third week in July (Fri 19th) for writing and 2nd August 2024 for editing.\n\nQ2 Budget and Spend [22:08]: see \"AI Ethics WG Quarter 2 payments and budget rec\" spreadsheet. Vani explained how this doc takes the Q2 budget written by Peter, Esther and herself, and fits it to the work that's actually been done, including the strategy drafting work (with more money than originally planned); and Vani's own work in setting up the WG. No objections. BUT it was noted that Colleen did some co-ordinating work in Q2 that needs to be added.\n\nA Co-chair[26:33] Consensus is reached, the WG is to have a Co-chair who will work with the Global AI Ethics Initiative (GEI) team (Haley, Esther) and with LeeLoo as the other Co-Chair, but from the Foundation side.\n\nSelecting Co-ordination Roles for Q3 [29:58]: A Cryptpad document will be created so anyone/everyone can drop anonymous comments in favour (or otherwise) of the “contestants” for various posts including the Co-chair role, to help us decide. \nThose interested: \nCo-chair: Colleen, Clement, Duke, Vani.\nWG Reportbacks: Jenn\nAsync work support: Love, Gorga, Malik, Slate.\nWG internal management: Kenichi, Sucre, Ayo.\n\nQ2 quarterly report, and Budget for Q3 [41:28]: Have been submitted, Members of the WG who are Core Contributors are reminded to submit consent forms for the WG budget and for other G and WG budgets.\n\nForum for AI ethics discussions [42:12]: Peter will create the forum. Clement signified interest in moderator role, which will be rewarded from the contingency budget.\n\nWhen to meet [54:47]: Meeting time will move to 14:00 UTC, and next meeting is 8th July 2024.\n\nMeeting ends: 59:17.\n\nNote: this meeting summary significantly amended and tidied by Vani - issues such as lack of clarity in narrative section and some things incorrectly documented; not including things as decisions/action items; not using decision rationales",

The meeting also focused on the points system allocation from June and Zealy updates.\n\nThe meeting started with Kenichi welcoming, and then he mentioned that we only had a few items to discuss on the agenda. He started by citing the WWG Q2 journey and how we can move forward progressively.\n\nSecondly, he mentioned the points system allocation from June and the reward balance in the Treasury. He was impressed with the performances from June, and he pointed out that whether we increase Q3 deliverables or not or our budget gets slashed, we can also visit the points system reserve to draw more pools. He also shed light on the Q3 budget concerns and the need for members to consent to the budget proposal after the meeting.\n\nFollowing a discussion with the points system, Kenichi shared his screen, and he showcased the publication matrix on Medium. In the month of June, 6 articles were published on the ecosystem page, which amassed 803 reads, amounting to 1.5k views. Owing to the fact that the SingulularityNET community page is still in its infancy, the page has also amassed over 133 views, 71+ reads, and 17 followers. Without hesitation, Advance Ameyaw suggested that we strive to increase the community page engagement and also attract new followers by implementing a system, where people can invite friends and get points. Kenichi appreciated his contribution and said that we already have a system that works, which is Zealy itself, and there is an invite-friend quest on the board!\n\nProgressively, we moved over to the Zealy side of things, and Kenichi announced that the current sprint is 10 days away from ending. Following that, we discussed the X Spanish page; Kenichi also mentioned that he'd love to know how Mikasa and Ines are tracking their activity hours — the need for tracking activity hours is essential because it is part of the concerns that were raised in Q2. He also added that the Scribes and Scribblers should try to attend the governance call whenever concerns like this are raised.\n\nKenichi emphasized the need for having the “pupil tag,” while stating that we give the tag to people who attend our meetings.  Since our Dework channel is private, people with the pupil tag will be able to see our channel and follow up on discussions around the WWG. More so, Kenichi headed over to the “Scribbler Onboarding Form” to see how many people had filled out the form. We spotted a new response, and we would reach out! Momentarily, Mikasa asked Kenichi why we paused the “biweekly cohort session.” Kenichi cleared the air by saying that people preferred having their onboarding session during the meeting rather than editing documents, he also added that the WWG might reinstate the cohort session once again.\n\nAs a matter of finality, Kenichi announced the launch of the new “Mindplex Series: Super AI.” Lastly, he stated that he will work on the first series while other Scribblers will write on the future series yet to come. \n",

Onyeka suggests a cross-country community approach while being mindful of the program’s budget. \n\nCreative quarterly bounties: To be discussed further for ideation in the next meeting.\nCross collaboration with AI Ethics WG: A SNET African Guild AI Ethics Expo, a collaborative event effort being accomplished alongside the AI Ethics workgroup.\nTown Hall Updates: Takers asked for who will do the townhall updates\nOnboarding Structure Update: Sucre urged people to make further contributions to the onboarding structure document.\nAMA Session Update: Ese reports that the AMA preparations are in the marketing phase and everything on queue.\nQ2 Report and Q3 Budget: Link shared so everyone can see, read and drop comments where they deem necessary. Duke sheds light on the circumstances of the report completion. Also budget approval is not automatic. All fingers advised to be crossed.\nAOB: Sucre wanted to understand why the Telegram group isn’t as active as before. Duke responded that it is difficult to discuss operational subjects on Telegram as there are people in the Telegram group who have yet to onboard to the Ambassador Program itself, which is a prerequisite to being a member. A concern was raised about why we are still using Google Meet and not Zoom. Resolved with an action item.\nClosing: All hands to be on deck for the furtherance of the objectives of the guild. Appreciation to everyone about how the AG call was free from tension that could have come from the Governance call.",

Following that, Cjfrankie asked Lady Tempestt, and Devon to share updates on their task, which they did!\n\nKenichi hops on the call and takes the wheel. As Q2 2024 concludes, the WWG reflects on our achievements in Q2. With screen sharing, Kenichi shares the community page progress — so far, four authors have published their articles, namely Ines, Devon, Cjfrankie, and Lady Tempestt.\n\nProgressively, Kenichi shared an update from the Zealy and Notion sides of things, highlighting our journey and the progress the workgroup has achieved in the last few months. We also talked about our substack and how to implement a comment session for people to voice their opinions as they read the monthly recap. Kenichi also pointed out that we have a French speaker in the person of Emmanuel Isaac — going forward, he will be managing the WG French page on X.\n\nMomentarily, Onize, who recently took the WWG, asked, “Can aspirants who didn't pass the WWG test still take on tasks?” This question was followed up with Kenichi’s reply, saying that the WG might implement the “taskforce mechanism.” The idea is to enable people without the Scribbler tag who possess certain skills like graphics, to be able to pick up tasks and earn rewards for their contributions.\n\nWe reached our Q2 KPIs through collaborative efforts - see y'all next quarter!\n\nWe had discussions centered around the points system and how to increase transparency  — Lady Tempestt, who emphasized making the system more transparent because many people in the community seem to have little knowledge about how it works. Kenichi shares the metrics, and what’s being measured, and how contributors earn the allocation. In view of the points system allocation and how to be more transparent, Lady Tempestt suggests that the WG could write a detailed document that highlights how the points are assigned and why people get a certain share.\n\nThe meeting ended with Kenichi announcing the trivia session that would be held today, noting that everyone should get ready for a thrilling session. Everyone expressed their thoughts, and we talked about the current people leading the trivia and how they could make room for other people to win; we all laughed, and we called it a day! See y'all next quarter.\n",

        "narrative": "On “naming”,\n- How to frame it? This quarter, we are trialling consent decision-making processes, so we need a proposal. Should it be \"change the name\" or \"don't change it\"? Which one is used would probably affect the results, since generally people tend to agree with a proposal rather than argue against it.  Proposal is that it should be a 2 step process: “Change the name” but without specifying what to change it to, and then decide what the new name should be afterwards.\n- We need a context-setting doc to explain what decision is being made, and maybe collate some pros and cons that have been shared in the community already. These should be sourced (i.e. not our opinions, but things that have been said up to now, ideally with links). Onboarding WG can do this.\n- Citizen OS (the proposed decision making tool for this decision) seems quite intuitive, so altho Onboarding could also look at creating a video walkthru of it, this is probably not needed.\n- We didn’t agree how we will progress the naming decision, or who will share it with Core Contributors and when.\n\nOn tooling,\n- We discussed using Citizen OS or Unanimous tool (both free and OS) for the Naming and Q2 Budget decisions, and agreed on Citizen OS\n- Unanimous could give us a demo: Week of 22nd April?\n- People could also use both of these tools in their workgroups - either for real decisions, or simulated ones\n- We didn’t decide whether we will try to use 1 account or everyone create their own.\n- We agreed that whenever a tool is used, the users should collect some feedback on how it went. - There was discussion of what the criteria should be to assess a tool - suggestions are being drafted in the doc Gov Sandbox Turn #1 - Testing Tools but we didn’t finalise it or decide how and where to share the criteria.\n- Concerns were raised on privacy/transparency - we don’t know who can see people's responses in Citizen OS and agreed we need to find out, and tell people, before we ask them to use the tool.\n\nOn Q2 budget:\n- We agreed there should be individual decisions on each WG’s budget. There are 14 WGs in total, but not all of them will need to submit a budget request for Q2 due to rise in token price and/or budget elements from Q1 carrying over, so it will be fewer then 14 decisions.\n- There was discussion of whether we should set a deadline for all budgets to be submitted and only ask Core Contributors to decide once all the budgets are in, because then we can make informed assessment of the budget allocation overall; or whether it should be a rolling process to accommodate WGs who submit their budget late. We decided to set a deadline for Q2 budgets to be submitted, but didn’t agree on the date.\n- Briefly discussed what the criteria should be for making a decision on a budget, and what should be shared with Core Contributors about this; but didn’t make a decision on this. Carry over to next Governance meeting.\n- We started drafting in the Governance Sandbox:Tool Testing doc how the decision will be set up in Citizen OS. Agreed Guillermo will set it up but we didn’t agree a date - just some time in April.\n\nTo be discussed further in a Treasury meeting:\n- whether budget approval should be related to the WG’s quarterly report for the previous quarter, and whether they have done what they said they would do?\n- what level of flexibility a WG should have to reassign their agreed budget in response to changing conditions. Not definitely agreed on?\n",

This is coming from the entire guild. Then that will give it much more credibility, which is what we should be looking for.

          "Skills share matrix; -Session on “Documentation” on the 15th August - Tuso was assigned to timestamp and post the recording (budget is $30) -Vani suggested that we get a feedback from Colleen to see if she would be available to do it before we assign it to her or even set a date for the session. -We decided to extend this conversation on \"What would be the extra training for this Quarter \"to the next meeting since we weren't getting enough responses from the members in the call ",
          "Assigning other work we budgeted for: We decided that Ayo and Kateri are going to work on the research interview design while Vani helps with the analysis of the survey responses."

The whole  group took alook at the video and commended the work but the major concern was the compensation for the work, Lordkizzy made emphasis on the tight budget the video WG are currently working with for Q3 and says it will be outrageous to pay $50 per person ($100) for a clip when we have a budget of $20 each for 12 clips, Lily dropped in an mentioned that the entire video was created from scratch and we should conside it as a long video rather than a clip, slate also indicated that once we pay this out someone can perform similar task and be expecting the same pay which is not feasible for us, so Lordkizzy suggested we compensate their efforts with $30 each and we decided to put it to a poll since the conversation was taking a while.

Ayo encouraged all core contributors to attend their consent-ing responsibilities.\n\nQ3 in Perspective \nAyo explained that there are only two objectives for the Guild in Q3, one to understand the need of the program and the perspective in which contributors in the program expects the Guild to function, two is to facilitate a workshop in partnership with the Writer and Video Workgroups and Marketing Guild. Ayo shared that the Q3 report is based on the outcome  of two objectives of the Guild.\n\nDiscussion on Survey Ideas and Participation\nThere are two open documents to which people are expected to contribute. The Possible Survey Questions [Strategy Guild] and the Strategy Guild Working Document.\n\nDiscussion on Tools and Meeting Time\nAfter contributions from Ayo and Clement, consensus was that the Guild will be open to exploring whatever tools can best serve the interest and uniqueness of the Guild. The meeting will also remain at 4pm UTC weekly Mondays.\n\n\nDiscussion on Guild Leadership and Rotating Facilitation\nPeter broached the discussion of Guild Lead and Facilitation rotation, Ayo acknowledged the vote of confidence from Gorga, who suggested that Ayo should be the Guild Lead, it was decided that because of time it should be put into the 22nd July Guild meeting agenda so it can be properly discussed.\n",

He showcased the building and the playground behind it, demonstrated a device for teleporting to the upper floor, and expressed his desire to create a workstation.

Momentarily, Gorga unmutes his mic, and he appreciates everyone for their support and love.\n\nFollowing that, Mikasa expresses her concerns about the unpublished meeting summaries! July is wrapping up, and the Scribes need to deliver the “SNET Ambassador Program Recap.” Cjfrankie suggests we can get some of the summaries from the meeting tool by navigating down the site to download the PDF version.\n\nToday's meeting marked the presence of Eveline Trinite, who introduced herself and showcased her keen interest in the WG. After the introduction, Mikasa said that she would reach out to her to help her get involved in the WG. In a flash, Merryman also introduced him, and he expressed interest in contributing to the WG.\n\nCjfrankie also put Advanced Ameyaw in the spotlight by asking him how he felt while taking the WG’s TEST, and he also hinted that the TEST was quite hard for him! Moved with enthusiasm, Advance asked a question “How do the WWGs operate?.” And if they also collaborate with the spinoffs, Cjfrankie cleared the air by highlighting the WWG goals and mission. He also pointed out that the WG has worked with other spin-offs like “Cogito.” We have also written a couple of drafts for Cogito, and we have close contact with Sandra.\n\nMEETING AGENDA: Lady Tempestt emphasized the need for having a structured agenda for our weekly meeting to help us stay organized.\n\nAyo, from the Strategy Guild, talked about the forthcoming workshop scheduled for the 29th of May, 2024. According to Ayo, the workshop needs 2-3 persons who would represent the WWG in the workshop, and then Mikasa, Cjfrankie, and Gorga expressed their interests.\n",

We kicked things off from the Zealy side of things; thankfully, the Zealy sprint has ended, however, the random winners🏆 haven't been announced yet. Momentarily, Kenichi added that the next sprint should start immediately — July 22nd, to be precise. Kenichi also suggested that we should repeat some quests from last quarter; he also hinted that the last sprint had a low turnout rate and a decline in participation compared to other springs.\n\nDework update: Cjfrankie and Devon share an update on the current tasks assigned to them.\n\nFollowing that, Kenichi called the Scribbler's attention to the community page, and he added that the community page is out of draft. He also encouraged the Scribes to source for more drafts. Kenichi added that he would dig into the inventory to source old, unpublished articles pending the time when new drafts will be ready! \n\nFrom a bird’s-eye view, July looks like a transformative month for the WWG: we crossed our KPI of 200 followers on the ambassador's medium page, but we're not stopping there! We need more people to engage with our content.\n\nPeer Review: Following a discussion with the writer's WG test submission, Kenichi still emphasized the need for using suggestion mode to edit drafts so that the writers can see what changes were made. Kenichi also commended Nengi for her test;  momentarily, he announced that Nengi is now officially a Scribbler and that he will get the Scribbler tag for her. He also encouraged the Scribes to keep sharing the WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form since we haven't reached our onboarding number for Q3.\n\nFollowing the revamped marketing guild, marketing wants to join forces with the writer's workgroup. To this effect, Kenichi proposed a giveaway or airdrop initiative where people with the highest Zealy points get rewarded with an \n",

Worked thru the GitHub board, beginning with \"in progress\" items.\n\nThe 3 strategy drafts (research strategy, ethics strategy, knowledge management strategy) are written, and are now handed over to their respective editing teams, with a deadline of 2nd August.\n\nDiscussion on how to pay the strategy-writing teams. They each have a total of $300, originally planned as $100 per person - but what is fair when not everyone in each team took part? Should someone be docked money for adding their input a couple of (weekend) days late? If people didn't contribute anything, or contributed less,  to their group's doc, what should they be paid, if anything? How should we approach things if someone was ill? etc. Some discussion on the importance of deadlines vs the importance of a degree of flexibility; the need for communicating any blockers to the rest of your team; and the difficulties and rewards of asynchronous working in small teams. \n\nThe Knowledge Management team's decision was made very rapidly in the meeting itself; the Ethics strategy team have had some prior discussion and are not all agreed, but they may prefer to leave it as it is and avoid a dispute; the Research strategy team seem to be agreed.\n\nWe ran through the work that has been done by the WG admin roles (Jen''s reportback to the GEI; internal WG management; WG async support, co-chair, and co-chair mentor). See GitHub Board for details.\n\nLadyTempestt as async work support raised the point that it can be hard sometimes to \"be in the middle\" and not to intervene.\n\nDiscussed what Clement's fee should be for AI Ethics Forum moderation.\n\nDiscussed how to fund documenting the GEI meetings as well as our WG meetings.\n\nAgreed to pay Colleen for the small amount of co-ordination work she did in Q2.\n\nDiscussed open tasks in the Q3 budget - \"AI Ethics conversations\" and \"Interviewing\".\n\nNoted that our Q3 budget line for \"Producing educational resources\" will have to be moved to Q4 due to budget-fitting. Also noted that Education WG is making some video learning resources on AI this quarter, so if we do decide to do this in Q4 we will need to be aware of what Education WG has produced, and be sure not to duplicate.\n\nDiscussed possible tasks for AGI-24 conference, August 13th-16th; and for the pre-event on 7th August. To be funded via the match-funding of this WG's Q2 budget that Esther secured from the Foundation. We noted that nobody from the WG is now going to Seattle in person due to high flight prices, so we will focus on virtual activities - fishbowl interviews; a virtual chillout room; etc. Noted that due to short timescale, we need people who don't need training or support to do these tasks; and noted the need for people to be honest about their skills.\n\n",

The discussion also included updates on uploading past meeting summaries and the need to ideate on strategies to increase African participation in the guild.\n\nDuke Peter: AI Ethics Expo Planning and Members Collective\n\nDuke Peter provided details about the upcoming AI Ethics Expo in Nigeria, emphasizing the collaboration between the AI Ethics Work Group and the African Guild. They outlined plans for the event, including securing a venue, engaging speakers, and budget allocation. Additionally, they explained the purpose and process of the member's collective initiative, which aims to fund ideas from guild members to contribute to the guild's growth and achievement of KPIs.\n\nPlanning the AI Ethics Expo\n\nEse Williams questions the roles of the four participants for the AI Ethics Expo, leading to a discussion on the implementation of proposed ideas and the need for volunteers to assist with the event. The conversation also addresses the selection process, potential locations for the event, and the possibility of covering travel expenses for participants.\n\nQ3 Budget Updates\n\nDuke Peter addresses the need to revise budgets in light of pending approvals from the treasury for strategy, marketing, and writers. They express the possibility of budget cuts and emphasize the need for careful spending, as the current budget lacks contingency provisions. The discussion also touches on the majority of the budget being allocated to recurring operational work.\n\nFeedback on African Guild progress\n\nDuke Peter asks for feedback on the African Guild's progress and receives positive comments from Clement Umoh.\n\nDuke Peter leads a discussion on the progress of the African Guild, with Ese Williams expressing satisfaction with the experience and suggesting improvements in organization and time management. \n\nDuke Peter seeked opinions on the pace of progress and coordination, while also considering the idea of providing giveaways for consistent meeting attendance. \n\nMember concerns: Discussion on AAG Token and Guild Outreach Initiative\n\nEse Williams expresses confusion about the AAG token and its legitimacy, prompting Clement Umoh to caution against engaging with it. Duke Peter shares plans for the African Guild AI Ethics Expo as the first outreach initiative and encourages input from the group. The meeting concludes with plans for future meetings and a reminder to communicate any scheduling conflicts.\n\nGeneral Summary:\n\nDuke Peter proposed two options to address scheduling conflicts: complaining to governance or changing the meeting time. \n\nThe group also discussed plans for an AI Ethics Expo in Nigeria, with a proposed collaboration between the AI Ethics Work Group and the African Guild.\n\n The event is projected for August or September, with a focus on securing a suitable venue and speakers, and a budget split between the two groups.\n\nAdditionally, they highlighted the importance of the members' collective initiative for generating ideas to drive the guild forward. The group also discussed the need to revise budgets due to pending approvals from the treasury for strategy, marketing, and writers. They anticipate potential budget cuts and emphasize the importance of diligent spending in the upcoming quarter.\n\nThe meeting also included a feedback session on the African Guild's progress, with positive remarks from Clement Umoh. The conversation then transitioned to concerns about the meeting venue, with issues of overlapping meetings and difficulties accessing the platform discussed. Potential solutions, such as addressing the overlapping meetings or changing the meeting time, were proposed and put to a vote, with the group ultimately deciding to move the meeting to 5 p.m. on Thursdays.\n\nThe group also discussed the progress of the African Guild, with Ese Williams expressing positive feedback and suggesting improvements in organization and time management. Duke Peter sought opinions on the pace of progress and the need for better coordination, while also mentioning the possibility of giveaways for consistent meeting attendance. Finally, the group announced the African Guild AI Ethics Expo as the first outreach initiative and invited thoughts from the group.\n",

He emphasized the need for contributions and partnerships and highlighted the challenges and opportunities in each country's regulatory landscape. The team also discussed modifying strategies for the marketing section, and Love Owokere raised concerns about the marketing initiative channel and meeting scheduling with Ese Williams. Ese explained the process of scheduling and clarified the approach taken.\n\nThe meeting section focused on the initial formation of a four-man group and the potential expansion of the team. Clement led a detailed discussion on the AI Ethics Expo, covering the event's physical location in Nigeria, the roles of participants in content creation, documentation, media, and monitoring, and evaluation, and the idea of project pitching as part of the event's content. The team also discussed the need for concrete updates on progress in the next meeting and the potential for wider participation in the event.\n\nFinally, the team discussed the need to remind Peter about updates for a time change and make a general announcement.

If we have the wallet address where we would send the NFT, then we could equally just have a whitelist without having the NFTs\nWe discussed possibility of continuing to use Google Forms, but noted that it can be very gameable unless we ask for email addresses to be sure people are only completing the form once, and that they are Core Contributors.\nNo decision made - need to carry this over to a future meeting\n\nWhat decisions do we think will be made in Q3?\n- Q3 budgets, obviously\n- Also, looks like we will need to decide how people get the Core Contributor role. At the moment, self-nomination is enough, but we felt there might be potential problems with that - we need to decide whether we want to have criteria, and if so, how strictly we want to enforce them.\nWe agreed that we want to keep some element of “the human touch” in how we decide who is “in” - i.e. it shouldn’t be just rigidly done in terms of a set of criteria - but that how the “human touch” should work probably needs refining.\nWe agreed that there might be more to say on this topic and it should be carried over to the next meeting on 28th May\n\nTo carry over to next meeting:\nNaming decision (do we keep the name Core Contributor?)\nWhat decision making method should we use in Q3\nWhat decisions will we make in Q3\n(from previous meeting) retrospective on Q2’s governance experiments, and writing it up\n\nNext meeting, Tues 21st May, is the budget consent discussion\nNext ordinary meeting is Tues 28th May.\n\n",

Or should this be an overall amount across the Program?\nHow detailed should a budget be? Do we need to give guidance on this? Feedback suggested that a) WGs do need to break their budgets down clearly enough that people know what they plan to spend, but b) there ideally needs to be scope for flexibility and responsiveness, so maybe it should not be overly specific. The intention matters more than the details? (e.g. you would say “we want to create resources to help onboard people” rather than “we will make 2 videos and 1 infographic with XYZ content)\n- Should a budget be linked to a quarterly report? How?\n- Should submitting a quarterly report be compulsory in order to have your budget approved? Should the quarterly report be submitted at the same time as submitting a budget, and/or actually linked and referred to in your budget sheet?  And - are there standards for what a quarterly report should be like? If it’s really perfunctory and not very informative, can it lead to a budget request being refused?\n- And (on the question of flexibility and responsiveness) - how closely does a WG need to stick to its proposed budget?

Firstly, Emmanuel Isaac and Mikasa shared an update from the Twitter management side of things. Emmanuel said that he has submitted the KPI for Q3, and he has created a draft for the content calendar which will start rolling out next week.\n\nSecondly, Kenichi raised a discussion on the recent test taken by WWG aspirants — he also pointed out that the aspirants should enable suggestion mode to reflect the actual changes that they made. The aspirants should also open edit access and follow the exact instructions that were mentioned in the test. So far, three scribblers have reviewed the test done by Nengi and Gorga, while Kenichi will do the aggregate to show their total score, and if they reach the threshold, they will be welcomed to the WG.\n\nKenichi also pointed out some slips from Slate's article “Medical Advisor Roundtable: Chronic Disease” and why he still needs to make changes to the document. Kenichi also emphasized the need for more Twitter threads, and he also pointed out that Twitter threads aren't exclusive to Mikasa; other scribblers can find interesting topics and then showcase them during meetings.\n\nWe discussed “timestamped video shorts\", and how we can embed them within our Medium articles to increase traction and engagement. Kenichi added that he will create a list of all the pending drafts and then give the video to WG. Devon asked, “What kind of videos?” Kenichi answered by saying that the shorts would be created from existing videos and would be no longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds. Lady Tempestt added that the scribblers should decide which part is the most captivating in a video, and then the video gets a timestamp. \n\nWe started a thrilling discussion centered around Zealy; thankfully, the current sprint is ending in a few days! Kenichi also shared insider tips on the sprinters' matrix;  the current sprint has 36+ participants. We also talked about restructuring the Zealy rewards. Here’s the breakdown: the top 5 get $30 each, the next 5 get $20 each, the next 10 get $10 each, and 10 random people will earn $10 each. This decision was made to incentivize more people for their participation and time.\n\nAs a matter of finality, Ayo added that we should always give consent to new proposals to enable them to pass. He also spilled the beans by giving us insider tips from the Strategy Guild. The guild is looking forward to hosting a workshop that will involve the Writers' WG and video WG in their pipeline — more updates will be coming soon!",

The whole  group took alook at the video and commended the work but the major concern was the compensation for the work, Lordkizzy made emphasis on the tight budget the video WG are currently working with for Q3 and says it will be outrageous to pay $50 per person ($100) for a clip when we have a budget of $20 each for 12 clips, Lily dropped in an mentioned that the entire video was created from scratch and we should conside it as a long video rather than a clip, slate also indicated that once we pay this out someone can perform similar task and be expecting the same pay which is not feasible for us, so Lordkizzy suggested we compensate their efforts with $30 each and we decided to put it to a poll since the conversation was taking a while.

        "narrative": "Our first meeting in August started strong with a warm welcome greeting from Kenichi, and momentarily, he surfed the WG’s dework board to cite the tasks in progress — Gorga, Ines, and Devon gave us an update on their tasks. Following that, Kenichi emphasized that scribblers should always keep prior bars in mind. Then Cjfrankie shared insights into his journey by providing Gorga with assistance as a new scribbler!\n\n\nMeeting Agenda: Having ticked off the action items from the last meeting, the meeting officially started with a discussion on July’s points system. Kenichi says that the disbursement didn't happen last Tuesday because there were still many tasks left undone and we needed to clear that off. \n\n\nAgenda item number three features a discussion about September projections! Kenichi says that we might be a mile away from launching the long-anticipated podcast. He also hinted that the marketing guild and video workgroup will play a role in making the podcast come to life. Lastly, he mentioned that anyone interested can start a conversation in the writer's channel, plus we can also start a thread, too.\n\n\nFollowing that, we talked about the Q2 SNET ambassador programs’ monthly recap and the future recaps for substack; since the recaps are usually lengthy, Kenichi says that there's a need to split the recap into workgroups and guild updates separately. \n\n\nOnboarding: From a bird's-eye view, there is a massive surge of interest in the WWG. Kenichi pointed out that we have almost reached our KPI for Q3, and at the moment there are only three spots left for scribblers this quarter, so the onboarding window for Q3 2024 will be closed after we have onboarded five scribblers in Q3.\n\nFrom the Zealy side of things, Cjfrankie talks about spotting a user who has multiple accounts — Gorga, LordKizzy, and several other people present gave their opinions on how we can mitigate the issue. Kenichi added that we can't prevent users from having multiple accounts, and the best approach would be to do a check after the sprint. Whenever we cite multiple accounts by a user, we can check the proof of humanity by tracking how old their Twitter account is or by using the sprinter tag to track how old the account is, and finally, the reward will only go to one account. \n\n\nFollowing that, Devon shared updates from the video reviews on Zealy. As a matter of finality, LordKizzy suggested that we have a channel where we can discuss zealy-related topics.\n",
