We commented that  - like a knowledge graph, this is a visual way of representing structures and connections. The conversational interface in the game may be useful for structuring questions about the archive - e.g. a gamified way to explore a knowledge graph - it would be amazing in the long term if the Archives itself could be integrated with the game, so that in the Archives room, a player could actually access and search the Archives.",

So how do we structure our data to prepare it for interfacing with generative AI?   This will be the next phase of the work on this issue - we are now pivoting to a graph structure to give better context and dimensionality.  - You create an instance (in the cloud, for scalability, if you have a large dataset) - Import is from a CSV file, but you an also integrate graph sources and other sources - It creates nodes (data entities) - You can then design your own conceptual schema/framework on top of this layer, to define what the edges are that connect the nodes.

We'll give reminders in Town Hall tonight, and on Discord; and hopefully discuss in Governance meeting on Thurs 9th or Thurs 16th when we have more input.  Retrospective on Q1 consent process: - We noted that GovWG meeting on Tues 14th is scheduled to be the retrospective session on the Q1 budget consent process. - Peter has yet to DM Core Contributors who didn't take part in the Q1 budget approval process, to find out why they didn't. He'll do it as soon as poss. - We will also ask Tevo if he has data on how many Core Contributors did take part this time (it's hard to tell from the Googleform responses, as people submit one per WG so it is hard to see how many unique consenters there were). - We noted it could be interesting in the retrospective to consider overall patterns of *how* consenters took part (e.g. were there fewer objections than last time? Were objections similar to last time, or different? Were there people who blanket unapproved all WGs, like there was last time?)  Documentation of Governance WG meetings - We agreed it's not an entry-level task. - We agreed the low-ish price ($20) might be putting people off doing it; people might also be put off by feeling that summaries need to be very detailed - We noted that there is still quite a bit of work to do on the backlog of summaries from Q3 and Q4 - there are people working on it, but $20 feels very low, as backlog work is harder since it's not fresh in the mind - We discussed whether people should be able to document meetings they were not present at, and concluded that while it's better if you were there, it's OK to work from the Read.ai transcript (though *not* from just the Read.ai summary, as those are often very inaccurate) - We agreed that to make documentation less onerous (especially for the backlog work) it is OK to focus on decisions, action items, and who was present - We agreed to raise the price (see 'decisions')  Next WG Sync Call date  - Next call is supposed to be Thurs 30th Jan at 10:00 UTC - is this too early in the day? Peter will ask in Town Hall tonight about preferred date and time - possibly move to Weds 29th at 13:00 UTC  WG unspent budget / budget reserves - We outlined the current process (unspent budget used to be clawed back by Treasury - but since Jan last year, it has not been. Anything that a WG doesn't spend, becomes part of their WG reserves and they can still use it.) - Should there be a time limit on how long a WG has to use budget that was allocated to a particular task? And if they want to change what they use it for, how should they do that? - How to avoid gaming the system (e.g. submitting a quarterly budget to do amazing things, to ensure consent; but then changing it to less impressive things in the first week of the Quarter) - We agreed on a suggested approach based on a 'change request' process if a WG wants to make major changes (see 'Decisions' below) and agreed to submit this as a potential new Treasury Policy.",

(If no objections, the WG can go ahead: if anyone objects, we didn't decide how that should be processed. Discuss in a Governance meeting?) - A 35% + change request needs to be included in the WG's budget proposal for the following Quarter (note that it would be separate from, and in addition to, their budget cap for that Quarter. So if a WG has a cap of 5k AGIX for Quarter 2 2025, and has 1k AGIX unspent from Q1 that it wants to reallocate, it will therefore have a total of 6k AGIX to work with). - If a WG has unused budget at the end of a Quarter that they still intend to use as originally planned, they don't need to do anything special - they just do the work as and when they can.",

However, several people noted that some of the higher-budget workgroups were not entirely happy at the enforced lowering of their budgets; and that we still need to discuss and refine the process of setting caps and e.g deciding how a WG's cap can be changed.

They have addressed the issues raised in the consent form by: - reducing overall cost by c. $1k - reducing budget for accommodation - staying 2 days at their own expense - securing a presentation slot - planning to distribute merch and brochures - aiming to establish an Ethiopia branch of African Guild (during the time they are there at their own expense - setting definite KPIs - making some short videos, to use as part of a recap video later - writing a post-conference report - writing an article, in collab with Writers WG and Marketing Guild - committing to a post-event retrospective meeting in the Ambassador Program itself, where we can look at how it went, and use that information to help finalise our thinking on when and in what circumstances Reserves should be used for attending events (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yggRVo_-VzjDPvlgJtxeEp0G8oLx6i8sGYmU9mJiTT0/edit?usp=sharing)  The meeting noted that they have committed to a lot of work; and suggested they reduce some of their KPI targets (e.g. AI Ethics interviews from 20 to 10).  We also noted that where their proposal mentions 'partnerships', they don't have the authority to initiate actual partnerships with sNET, so this will be reworded to make it clear that it is just about collating contacts, and passing them on where appropriate so that any potential partnerships can be explored.  We also noted that a useful KPI would be getting interested people to attend Ambassador TH and relevant WGs - Clement and Ameyaw will add this.  And we agreed that their attendance at the event is a test-case for how Reserves should be spent on events - so we will use their post-event report, plus insights from a retrospective meeting when they return, to inform our final decisions on this issue (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yggRVo_-VzjDPvlgJtxeEp0G8oLx6i8sGYmU9mJiTT0/edit?usp=sharing)  Overall, the meeting agree that all the objections are addressed, so the proposal is approved; and we discussed how best to release funds (via a fund request on Dework).   We then ran through the document of suggestions on how to set Q2 2025 budget caps (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVd_4Ih-lSdMoIcmVeOS3_H3aqOdnMmMG6o1WqGTx1w/edit?usp=sharing), with some minor discussion for clarification.

Also - calculate who is a Core Contributor 🌟 Mon 17th March: deadline for Core Contributors to complete consent forms 🌟 Tues 18th March: discuss objections in Gov WG meeting. WGs without any objections are approved 🌟 Sun 23rd March: deadline for WGs with objections to submit a revised budget 🌟 Mon 24th March: 2nd-round consent forms go out, for those WGs that have objections 🌟 Weds 26th March: deadline for Core Contributors to submit 2nd consent forms 🌟 Thurs 27th March: discuss and finalise in Open Gov meeting  We have the dates for Q3 decision (June) and Q4 decision (Sept) worked out on a similar timeline; but we agreed to confirm these nearer the time. We also noted that for Q3, Guillermo/R&D's proposed dashboard will be ready, which might help streamline the decisionmaking process and shorten the timeline.  RE: setting an exchange rate to be used for Q2 budgets - we noted the current low token price, and suggested $0.35, but noted that the final decision doesn't need to be made until early March.  We discussed the suggestions in the 'Budget Caps for Q2' document, and decided our approach to the New Ideas budget; new workgroups; and budget cap amounts (see 'decisions' below).  In relation to budget caps - we emphasised that any WGs who feel their cap is too low need to prioritise, and there are not many WGs who have outputs that need to be protected regardless. WGs should also be encouraged to use their Q1 quarterly report to explain any negative effects of their budget caps - for example, listing the work that they would have liked to do but have been unable to do because their budget cap was too low - so that the community can assess whether their cap needs to be raised. But we did note that this process is quite slow.  The lobger term suggestions in the 'Budget caps for Q2?' doc particularly around the idea of WGs establishing minimums below which they can't operate - will be discussed in a later meeting.",

Perhaps create a list that minimally dedupes (stripping out misspellings and similar, and replacing tags like 'budget' with 'Q4 2024 budget' etc - or perhaps rely on semantic similarity.  We might come back to the insights gained from the tag taxonomy project in future (the types of topics that get discussed, and how they are distributed across different WGs) when looking at the types of questions that can be asked of the corpus.  But the work we thought we needed to do - the exhaustive 'tidying up' of the database and correcting / deduplicating tags -  is probably not necessary.

Semantic similarity is of course one approach to finding connections - but for some data elements (e.g. people's names) this doesn't work, as names are abstract and won't display any semantic relation - so this makes a controlled vocab for names more important.  For tags, however, a graph *can* find sematic similarity between different-but-similar tags - especially the emotional tags - so we might not need to be so assiduous in ensuring that similar tags ('discursive' vs 'exploratory' or whatever) are deduped.",

Then, we can constrain a graph to look only at Q2 summaries, and see what effect, if any, this has on the clarity and accuracy of information we are able to derive, and compare this with previous Quarters.

We assigned some tasks RE the Q2 budget decision (publicity and context-setting material, admin such as drafting consent form, plus this WG's own budget and Q1 2025 report)  We discussed what context-setting material is needed, and realised that we need material aimed at WGs to help them formulate their reports and budgets, as well as https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyZZLDqeeoDanbzyY7c9m7sy_hU5w9v5niuR4m521ms/edit?usp=sharing which is aimed at Core Contributors to inform them about the consent process.  We discussed how to fit the GovWG budget to our budget cap. We noted that because we have been operating close to the minimum level of activity that would be meaningful for the WG, there is not much room to make cuts. We are unwilling to reduce meetings, or to rely on Peter (who doesn't take payment) facilitating all meetings.  We also noted that this discussion has a bearing on the question of WG minimum budgets, as outlined in the 'Budget caps for Q2' discussion doc here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVd_4Ih-lSdMoIcmVeOS3_H3aqOdnMmMG6o1WqGTx1w/edit?usp=sharing and we noted that the approach we decided on (using WG reserves to cover any shortfall, and stating on our budget sheet which items will be covered this way) is a useful approach and should be included in the guidance we are writing for other WGs.  We briefly discussed the 'DRAFT process for how to use the 'New Ideas' budget' doc, but noted that there was not time to fully cover the issue. We briefly discussed the merits of a voting process versus a consent process for agreeing proposals to use the New Ideas budget.

        "narrative": "Criteria for core contributors:  In the last round, there was room for self-nomination and nomination by others, for people that didn't reach the criteria for getting the core contributor role.  The meeting  noted Tevo's comments in the GovWG Discord channel about the rewards threshold and participation threshold: 'Some of the downsides come because the rewards are more centralised to current core contributors and seems high earners are earning even more funds compared to last quarter, leaving out less tasks for people to reach 1000 AGIX threshold. In addition the core contributor list by rewards also affected by the price changes. The higher the AGIX price goes, the harder is to reach the threshold. However, the majority of renominated members are due to not attending enough meetings or not being recognized. From next quarter if people interested we can double down on Process Guild service to import Zoom participation to Treasury Manager, for now I do not know if we have funds for that. we definitely have the capability (even if still semi-automated)'.  and from Vani: 'But interestingly, this means we have 60 core contributors this time - and (what I am pretty sure is) a record 20% having been manually nominated. Hmmm... does this suggest we need to have a look at the criteria? Or are the criteria fine, and these are just anomalies?'  Currently we use:  1. Time-based recognition What does 'participation' mean? Is it just for passively attending meetings, or for actually taking part? speaking, commenting in Chat, etc) Vani noted that for now it is based only on attendance - we can't easily capture who is contributing in a meeting, as it could be complex to capture who spoke or commented in Chat.  2. Fund request recognition Clement noted that the criterion for having to be rewarded with at least 1000 AGIX in the last three months is not fair because of fluctuation in token price.  Peter noted that we don't require both time-based recognition and fund request recognition: it's either / or. However, the meeting still felt that the threshold should be in USD, not AGIX, to minimise the effects of token price fluctuation. After discussion, we agreed the threshold should be 300 USD a quarter.   Self nomination:  Should self-nomination continue to be possible, for people who have not reached the criteria for being a core contributor? Vani raised the issue of potential hostile capture if people can self-nominate, and suggested there should be no self-nomination; nominations should have to be made by an existing Core Contributor. Peter said he thinks it would usually be OK if a person is new and nominates themself. A poll was drawn and 11 people out of 14 said there should be no self nomination, but we agreed that we will revisit the decision after the end of Q1 2025.   Proposal for Attendance at the ETHiopia conference  https://eth-iopia.xyz/ By Clement and Advanceameyaw  They would like to be funded from Program reserves to represent sNET at this event. We noted that 2 focus groups have met to discuss criteria for using Reserves for event attendance - their recommendations have not yet been discussed or ratified, but this proposal meets most of them except a suggested budget limit per person. However, we also noted that this suggested limit may be too low - flights within Africa are very expensive, so a low budget limit could have the unintended effect of preventing African's from attending African events  The proposal was explained and we concluded that the proposal should be posted in Discord for all core contributors to consent or object,  and the results should be discussed in the Open Governance meeting on Thurs 28th Jan.",

INTERVIEWING - Several interview tasks from both Q4 2024 and this Quarter are still pending - Several 'interview' issues are still open because Vani is checking interview validity - slower process than expected. Perhaps next Quarter we'll train more people to do it too, to speed things up. - Several interviews haven't met the validity criteria that we set for payment - WG admin team will agree on thresholds to partially pay interviews that are not quite there. - Biggest issue is interviews too short. - Validity comprises 2 things - the WG's agreed criteria for payment, and validity for inclusion in BGI Nexus's research corpus - e.g. a too-short interview could still be included in the research. - Should we change our criteria for the next round of interviews? - Esther will lead a 'peer support'-style meeting for interviewers to discuss what we've all learnt.   AGI-24 PAYMENTS - People's work at AGI-24 has at last been paid! Thanks to Esther for working with the Foundation to find a way to process the payments. Although we didn't yet get a process in place that can be used in future, we now understand the administrative landscape better, and should be able to establish such a process next time there is direct payment from the Foundation to people in the Ambassador Program.  TRANSCRIPTION - Work hasn't started yet - there will be a training session before the end of Feb on how to transcribe, using Intelligent Verbatim style. - Several interviewers are happy to transcribe their own interviews, but for those who are not, there might be tasks for other people to pick up.  MATCH FUNDING - Esther has been trying to regularise match funding from the Foundation, rather than having to go through a process each Quarter - nothing definite yet - Possibly, match funding could support a small funding pipeline for events attendance and similar. - We agreed a meeting between Nexus and the WG would be useful to discuss how best to spend any future match funding that is secured from the Foundation to support the work; although the final decision should be made by BGI Nexus  BGI-25 CONFERENCE, ISTANBUL, MAY 2025 We discussed Ambassador Program involvement in this event, in the light of ongoing discussions on event attendance and spending Program reserves. No definite decisions, but we will get Peter's input and discuss BGI-25 again next meeting. We shouldn't leave it too late, to allow time for possible attendees to get visas.  SURVEY-SHARING Survey sharing tasks are now completed - overall cost was $180 ($30 x 6 people). So far, we got 57 complete responses as a result, and no partial responses; and there might be more to come. Might be worth doing more in a future Quarter - if we scale this (500-ish reponses would be meaningful, which would cost maybe $1,500), it is worth it given the value it adds to the research.  Q2 2025 BUDGET We looked at draft budget and discussed briefly - invited comments from members - TBC next meeting  STRATEGY GUILD WORKSHOP Gorga let the group know that later today there will be a Strategy Guild workshop to discuss AI Ethics work; this is part of Strategy Guild's ongoing sessions with different WGs.",

Esther, Ætherblade and CallyFromAuron are still doing a quick review on the completed interview recordings to check if everything needed is in place before proceeding to payments. AGI-24 payments to ambassadors involved; this will be resolved very soon(hopefully this month) with the foundation. We spoke a little bit more about how to sort future payments like this and get a fitting solution(invoice? Crypto? One-off contracts, etc). This discussion will also be taken up at the WG sync call for sure. Documenting BeGIN open office: There may not be recordings for some of these meetings so Onize can't document them. Admin team(WG Internal management, Co-Chair, WG Async Support, Community engagement, co-chair mentee) issues have been assigned to the respective assignees on GitHub. Conferences and Events(discussed here https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2024/december-2024/week-50): What AI Ethics Event should we attend this year? Should we focus on the ones organized by SNET itself only or should we look outside too? Here is a sheet on a list of future events and conferences we could check out 2025 AI Conventions, conferences and events  Colleen the community manager brought up community discussion on AI Autonomy as something she would like to do this quarter. It will be discussed more in the future.  WG Sync calls: any topics from AI Ethics? There is a rolling agenda. There is also a handy Google form here https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5c_9AyIgLGkmbG6zF-6ewhOfka6E8Obw7BFUOvcDM6fzdnw/viewform?usp=header  that collects feedback from people. Onto tasks 'in to-do' on Github We got updates(and some sort of 'no update') from people doing interviews in Q3 & Q4. Survey sharing: no updates on GitHub from most of the assignees. Moved a few of them who did it to 'in progress' and 'done'. The point here is to show evidence that they have shared them and no point waiting until the interested participants fill them out. Interview Transcription: We suggested that people who did interviews be the ones to initially transcribe the recordings since they are in the best position to understand the conversation. It also needs to be human-corrected. There will be a training session for it. Knowledge management/data analysis planning: This has more to do with what happens after the interviews are collected, how we work with the material obtained and how we analyze them.  Ideation and attracting donors: how are we going to attract donors of money, time, competing power and opinions? Colleen, TheFreysDefi, and Ese are the assignees.  Extra Connected AGI-24 payments topic Payments in AGIX; is it a good idea? Is it too much of a risk? Price fluctuations in the crypto world make it not much of a good idea. Should we price tasks a little bit higher to protect people's rewards? We could also set aside some sort of contingency budget for situations like that.",

        "discussion": "1) Workgroups represented on the call: We asked in Chat and found the following groups are present - Archives - AI Ethics - Onboarding - Translation - Writers - Marketing - R & D - Moderators - African Guild - Governance - Sandbox/Think Tank   2) WG minimum budgets - How to progress discussion on the idea, proposed in the 'budget caps for Q2' discussion doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVd_4Ih-lSdMoIcmVeOS3_H3aqOdnMmMG6o1WqGTx1w/edit?usp=sharing , that WGs should determine their minimum budgets - it was decided that Governance WG is the best place for this conversation, and that we should not actually discuss it in this meeting.  2) Increasingly late meeting start times: We recognised that it's difficult to fix without putting people off turning up at all. Suggestions included: - If you're late, your participation will not be counted (but most people would not mind that); - Start meetings at 5 mins past, regardless of who's present - of course this can't be enforced on WGs, but we could suggest it, and try it out in e.g. Governance, Town Hall, etc.  3) Archives WG will not be checking meeting summaries during Q2 - Meeting summaries are often inaccurate or garbled, and it is a lot of overhead to check and correct them. So for budget reasons *and* experimental reasons, Archives will stop doing this during Q2, and will simply approve and archive whatever is submitted. They will then test whether the graph RAG process they are developing is able to 'fill in the gaps' and derive meaningful and accurate information from summaries in Q2. If yes, it will be helpful to know that our archiving system doesn't require accurate summaries; and if no, we can assess what kinds of errors matter.  4) Googleform responses on what WG Sync calls should cover: see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYQb3U4AkXsxtOl7uHONFtfBkavicU1wleJskQKf5Ms/edit?usp=sharing There were 5 responses, all quite different. Key points:  - Some issues with not knowing when the call is (we need to keep publicising it)  - Best uses of time include cross-WG collaborations; feedback, evaluation, and knowledge sharing; top-level planning, and assigning relevant people to go off and discuss issues in more detail; external speakers.   - There was a suggestion of using the call for progress updates, but this was felt to be very similar to the monthly 'WG Updates' Town Hall, so perhaps not useful.  - Should NOT be used for: Grievances/conflict resolution (we note that there is a process in place for that, see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1beMEt9XmPvHNaH08Rh5_taTI0QhHcyy15Q6XcXXDWUI/edit?usp=sharing , though it has never been used); Personal ideas; Decisionmaking and detailed planning; Issues that belong in Governance meetings. Note that some people in the meeting disagreed with some of these.  - Future wishes for the calls - several of these have already started to be done; the idea of expert training sessions in the call itself, and followup discussion afterwards, remains to be discussed. We note that a previous Governance session (9th Jan 2025, https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2025/january-2025/week-2#governance-workgroup-1) discussed how to encourage attendance from all WGs - there was a suggestion of rewards from Program reserves for WGs that attended all 3 meetings in a Quarter; although we noted that given current token price, this might not be something we still want to do. Nevertheless, we have recorded which WGs were present.  5) End of Year Report 2024 - we agreed a final date of Sunday 9th March to finish the report https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TxKxP9sDNgvKncAqO0F-UhZgoftMdDktaqbt50-h2XM/edit?usp=sharing, and WGs who have not added material will do so by Fri 7th to allow time for a final proofread. We also noticed that several WGs (Education, Gamers, Strategy) have not added material *and* have not been coming to WG Sync calls - are they feeling excluded or disengaged in any way, or facing barriers? We did not reach conclusions on how or whether to ask them.  6) MeTTa Coder Lab: This is intended as a 'low-barrier-to-entry' way for people to learn MeTTa, and was originally a proposal in an RFP funding round, but was unsuccessful - so Guillermo is suggesting it as a cross-WG collaboration - education+ RND + AI SANDBOX +Onboarding plus any others who want to.  The proposal and other materials were shared and comments were invited. There will be meetings soon to discuss the collaboration and how to fund it.",

        "status": "carry over",
        "narrative": "We noted that in Q1, Process Guild voluntarily gave up 1,000 AGIX to help with budget fitting (reducing their cap from 2,000 to 1,000); so this should be restored in Q2. Since we have already said that budget caps will remain the same this Quarter as they were in Q1, the only way to do this is to give Process Guild 1,000 AGIX from Program reserves. We also agreed that we definitely need to reassess budget caps for Q3; and that this should be done in the light of the discussion on minimum budgets (the minimum a WG needs in order to operate).  Anonymity:  Peter noted that it can be difficult to resolve objections when the objectors are not present in the meeting and prepared to 'un-anonymise' themselves.   Vani said it can be difficult to raise concerns - especially serious, 'whistle-blowing' type concenrns - without anonymity. How will we make sure the space feels safe to raise things?  We recapped the point made in the previous meeting that the process is *not* anonymous now, because anyone with access to the Ambassador Gmail account can see who said what - but it's not clear if people fully realise that.  LordKizzy confirmed that the Governance dashboard being developed in R&D Guild will keep user identities anonymous to the public, but admins will still have access to this information - this raises the question of who should be an admin.   LadyTempestt stated that she doesn't feel OK raising issues in the budget consent forms ever since she found out that it is not confidential, so she just abstains.   We noted that it would be possible to create the consent forms on a different Google account that only 1 person has access to (perhaps Peter, given his particular role in the ecosystem).   Guillermo said that a non-anonymous consent process can foster a stronger community. When you fear to give your opinion whatever it is, it's not good - raising concerns openly will improve our professional relationships and help us learn to accept criticism. The planned Governance dashboard hopes to address this, and to make it easier for people to raise concerns transparently.  Vani said that while this *can* work, sometimes lack of anonymity means people give less honest feedback; so we get an apparent 'consensus' that isn't real. Also, any negative effects of removing anonymity are likely to fall more heavily on those who are already marginalized, or who feel the least confident or the least safe. Guillermo countered that having anonymity can make it more likely that people will raise unfair or nonsense concerns. Kizzy pointed out that if people do not attend the discussion meetings, they don't know that their concern has been resolved, and will raise it again next time, so we go round in circles. Guillermo suggested we could make it an option when the new Governance dashboard is built - people could choose whether or not they want to be anonymous. Vani referenced a previous Governance meeting where it was suggested that we need an independent person or group who maintain oversight, but are not otherwise involved in budget decisions, and are neutral. It was agreed back then that it would be difficult to find such a person  We noted that by the end of Q2, the Governance dashboard should be ready, and this might change things - so this Quarter might be the only chance we get to try out a non-anonymous consent process and see how it goes.  We checked the new sheet for Q2 which LordKizzy has added to the Budget Planner, and agreed the additions he needed to make to it.",

Other possible sessions for future Governance meetings:  - 1) We noted that Education Guild are planning to take on some educational sessions on governance issues - Vasu, Lord KIzzy and Vani are planning the sessions now, covering the core governance mechanisms in the Program - so this will cover the longstanding agenda item we have had about whether Governance WG itself should be undertaking governance education sessions  - 2) Kevin suggested a meeting with Mindplex - we decided this might not make so much sense as a Governance session, so Kevin will organise this outside of Governance meetings, perhaps under Marketing.  - 3) Tevo suggested discussing contribution systems, and who contributes - what are the patterns in the data we have, for example who are the 'high cost individuals', and should we aim to decentralise further on fund distribution? Others said that perhaps it's OK if 'high-cost individuals' are those who are prepared to do the most work. Also - look at the ratio of amount of work (in terms of MINS) vs amount earned in AGIX  - 4) we do need to discuss how to raise the issue of if/when a WG's outputs are felt to be low-quality.

He suggested allocating resources for physical meetups to enhance engagement and proposed that workgroups focus on making SingularityNET tools more accessible. He also requested clarification on whether SNET tools were used during the Hackathon.  - Advance explained that most hackathons operate in pools, often sponsored by different ecosystems like Mantle, and Ethereum in the context of the hackathon held during the program. Participants build projects using the sponsors' technologies, and those who integrate these tools effectively can receive funding or prizes. If SingularityNET were to sponsor a hackathon, it could incentivize developers to onboard their projects onto the AI Marketplace by offering prize pools for utilizing SNET services.  - Clement suggested that if SingularityNET had engaged earlier in the hackathon, it could have introduced the AI Marketplace sooner, leading to more participants utilizing its services. He recommended that SingularityNET consider sponsoring such events in the future to encourage developers to build on its platform and integrate its AI tools.  - Peter noted that SingularityNET is already sponsoring Hack India but emphasized that larger organizations like Deep Funding or the ASI Foundation are better suited for sponsorships. He highlighted that the AI Marketplace is still in beta, with many services as proof-of-concept. With the ASI merger, platforms like Agentverse and ASI Create will integrate, but onboarding developers remains unclear during this transition.",

We also noted that we did not establish any kind of quorum for this consent round - so even though some WGs only garnered very few responses (for example, Knowleddge Base only had 4), they still pass.  We started with the objections to AI Sandbox/Think Tank; this took most of the meeting and was still inconclusive by the end.  Key discussion points included:  ADMIN COSTS vs DELIVERABLES / OUTPUTS 2 objectors and 2 abstainers all commented that AI Sandbox/Think Tank is spending too high a proportion of their budget on admin (nearly 4x as much as they spend on outputs). In the discussion, it was suggested that perhaps some budget elements had been mis-described as admin, when actually they *are* outputs/deliverables. The nature of this WG means that its sessions are not just procedural meetings, but actual learning sessions or debates, so in effect, it delivers a community event each week, so in a sense, its meetings *are* 'outputs'.  WHAT ARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TASKS? Tevo said that the project management tasks he does in his own WGs only take him minutes to do, so he queried why AI Sandbox/Think Tank is taking so much longer. He suggested the WG's quarterly report should list the fixed tasks needed to prepare each of its sessions - the WG has learnt, after operating for a few months, what these tasks are.  GITHUB vs DEWORK MANAGEMENT COSTS Is the WG 'double-dipping' by costing for both GitHub and Dework management? No. Project management for this WG (as for many other WGs) is done on a GitHub Board - but in order to process payments, the information still needs to be copy-pasted into Dework tasks, because the Treasury system unfortunately doesn't integrate directly with GitHub. But we noted that there may be questions over how long this should take, and that using Dework templates could make it faster.  PAYMENTS STOPPED IN Q1 2025 It was noted as background info that during Q1, Treasury stopped payments to Sandbox/Think Tank for certain project management tasks, because they felt it was not clear enough in the Dework task what was being done; and LordKizzy amended the Dework tasks to give more detail.  VALUE OF TOOL EXHIBITION SESSIONS Tevo queried the value of the WG's tool exhibition sessions - do they give any more information about the tools than a person could gain by simply Googling? Are the selected tools actually useful? Should the sessions cover only sNET tools rather than just any AI tool? What is the impact of the sessions if nobody is actually using the tools under discussion? He acknowledged that perhaps the value is in the discussion itself, but still had questions, which were not fully resolved in this meeting.  PUBLIC GITHUB BOARD Lord Kizzy screenshared the AI Sandbox/Think Tank GitHub board, and realised that as they're using 2 separate repos, one of them is not public. He agreed to make it all public, to improve transparency.  DOCUMENTING PLANNING SESSIONS AND ASYNC WORK  There was a suggestion that the WG's planning meetings and async discussions need to be documented, for transparency. But it was noted that many WGs do this kind of work and don't document it publicly, and have not been asked to; so it is important to ensure we are not demanding something of AI Sandbox/Think Tank that is not being asked of other WGs.  We noted that in future Quarters, it could be made an absolute requirement for WGs to fully document this type of work, but it currently is not.  FLAT RATES FOR ADMIN COSTS? It was suggested that all WGs should pay the same for admin costs such as facilitation, documentation, etc. The counter-argument was that in line with WG autonomy, WGs should continue to be able to make their own decisions on this, within reason, and that some variation is OK; particularly because the tasks are not exactly the same from WG to WG. There was no final decision on this.  TO RESOLVE OBJECTIONS TO AI SANDBOX/THINK-TANK To resolve his objections, Tevo said that AI Sandbox/Think Tank need to: - 1) update their budget sheet to remove as many things as possible from project management and assign to either of the deliverables (AI Sandbox sessions or AI Think Tank session); - 2) if possible, lower the rewards for Dework task management, because it should use a template which they copy paste, and the work should not be more than 30 mins per week - 3) make their GitHub board fully public so we can see all the tasks - 4) explain in more detail, in the relevant GitHub issues, what the operational calls and async planning consist of, ideally including relevant links.",

We noted that the only objection for Translation WG (i.e. to add links in the Quarterly Report to the translated articles) has been addressed and the links have been added, so we confirmed that Translation WG's budget has now been approved. As an aside, we noted that some of the translated articles are not tagged, so it would be difficult for people to find them - but this task is supposed to be done by Iain Wentworth.  We discussed some of the issues raised in the objections to the 6 WGs that have not yet been approved, but did not reach a resolution on any of them.  We realised that the current schedule, which requires the 2nd-round consent forms to go out this Sunday, 23rd March, is not possible, so we amended it to push all the dates back by 1 week (see 'Decisions' below).   We also decided on some changes to the 2nd-round consent process to ensure fairness, and avoid an endless cycle of new objections (see 'Decisions' below). We recognised that it is unlikely that even another 2 meetings will completely resolve all the objections; so as GovWG our role is to ensure everyone knows what the objections are, and has easy access to the WGs' comments on them - people can then use the 2nd round consent process to say whether they feel the objection(s) against each as-yet-unapproved WG are an issue, or not. In this, we agreed that it would be valid for someone who did not object to a WG in round 1 to rethink based on the objections raised by other people, and to say in Round 2 'Actually, I agree that such-and-such is a problem', but not for them to add new objections of their own at this stage.",

        "narrative": "RESOLVING OBJECTIONS? Most of the objections are Tevo's; so because he was unable to be at this meeting, we were unable to try to resolve them.  We looked at the one other objection (by Vani, objecting to Writers' WG on the grounds of over-centralisation). Mikasa gave a defence saying that they have already planned to address the problem - but as this is exactly what was said last time the issue arose, Vani preferred not to resolve the objection, but to let it go to the consent process. So Writers' WG will address this in their 'response' doc.  There were no other objections by anyone other than Tevo.  CAN WE RULE ANY OBJECTIONS INVALID? We discussed whether we, as Governance WG, can rule any of the objections as 'invalid', as was done in previous rounds. For example, the objection to African Guild that they pay $25 per meeting for facilitation when the objector believes there should be a standard fee of $20 across the Program - we noted that there is no longer any agreed, enforcable 'standard fee', and that trying to impose one retroactively could infringe on the idea of workgroup autonomy, so this could therefore be considered an invalid objection. However, since Tevo isn't able to be here to discuss it, perhaps we should not rule out any objections as 'invalid', but should let all the objections go to the 2nd consent round - if individuals feel an objection is not valid, they will select 'objection has been addressed or is not an issue'.  This question will be looked at again in Thursday's meeting to confirm that we do not plan to rule any onbjection 'invalid' at this stage.  ARE OBJECTIONS INVALID IF THEY WERE NOT SUBMITTED IN THE 'WHAT IS YOUR OBJECTION' FIELD? We noted that some of the objections in the responses sheet were actually submitted in the 'What would need to change?' field, so it's not 100% clear that they are objections as such. (Example - the objection mentioned above, about African Guild paying $25 for documentation.) However, it is pretty clear from context that they are intended as objections.  SEPARATE THE INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIONS OUT? The draft 2nd-round consent form created by Vani separates each individual objection (even if it's part of a set of several points that were made by the same person), and asks people to agree / disagree with each one separately.  LordKizzy suggested that instead, we should give all the objections to a particular WG together, and ask people 'In the light of the above, do you consent or object to this WG's budget?' This might make the consenting process easier; but it might also mean that if someone only agrees with one of the objections, we won't know which one. This question will be looked at again in Thursday's meeting.  WHAT DOES '80/20' MEAN IN PRACTICE? We noted that it's not completely clear what the 80/20% rule means in this context. First - do abstentions count towards the total 'number of people who took part'? Is it '80%/20% including abstentions' or not? Second - to pass, does a WG need at least 80% of respondents saying 'this has been resolved, or is not an issue', or fewer than 20% saying 'this is still a problem'? This question will be looked at again in Thursday's meeting.  WHAT HAPPENS IF A WG'S BUDGET DOESN'T PASS? We realised that we have not definitely confirmed what the approach is this round. Will that be it - no budget? Or will there be any further attempts to resolve the situation? This question will be looked at again in Thursday's meeting",

Link was shared, and we agreed to promote it on Ambassador Discord channels; but we agreed that we'll check with BGI Nexus before promoting it more widely via general sNET channels, in case they want to take a more targeted approach at this stage.  2) END OF YEAR REPORT As agreed in the last WG Sync call, Vani has done a final proofread, and it is almost ready to go. Guillermo  will add a bit of detail on LatAm events later today, then it will be published probably tomorrow.  3) COLLABORATIONS WITH SPINOFFS AND PARTNERS We discussed how to progress this issue, which was discussed in the last WG sync call (particularly in the light of low token price - is there any way that collabs might support the Ambassador Program financially?) Decided the first step is to collate info on how different WGs are already working with spinoffs and partners - for example - we already translate the ecosystem monthly writeup - we had hackathon collab with fetch - AI Sandbox/ThinkTank has been working with NuNet - NuNet and BGI Nexus have attended Town Halls - LatAm and Onboarding are working with different spinoffs  Peter will create and share a spreadsheet and ask all WGs to add any collaborative work they are currently doing Then when we have this information, we can start writing a strategy for future efforts, covering marketing, LatAm, African, R&D, Onboarding, Education, and more.  4) MEETING ATTENDANCE and NEXT WG SYNC CALL This meeting was quite poorly attended. We felt that perhaps people would be more likely to attend if there's a specific topic for discussion, and particularly if it is something that clearly involves all WGs, such as 'WG collaborations with spinoffs and partners'. So we'll collect the info on what WGs are already doing, and hold an additional call on Monday 7th April to focus on this. We se;ected a later time (16:00 UTC) as the current time of 11:00 UTC might be excluding some people.",

        "narrative": "The Governance Workgroup discussed two major issues which are: Handling objections in decision-making and Dealing with budget cuts due to falling token prices.  We suggested a more structured way to address objections, either in meetings or asynchronously. Vani raised an issue about people consenting and not giving comments about why they are consenting. She feels it will be an issue amongst the workgroup. 'People are not saying what they feel because we've gotten rid of anonymity'(Vani). Peter also stated that if people are objecting and not saying the reasons for their objections then the objection seems irrelevant. Peter offered to help facilitate discussions and improve communication with better note-taking.  We suggested that the ongoing nature of the feedback form could allow for further clarification from objectors. We also acknowledged that the removal of anonymity might be discouraging honest feedback.  Budget concerns were a big topic, as the group's Q2 budget dropped by 33%. We explored solutions like adjusting payment schedules or delaying payments until prices recover. Vani also pointed out that we shouldn't respond to low token price by immediately going into volunteerism. We also noted that budget cuts were hurting participation, making governance harder to manage.  To improve discussions, We proposed unpaid facilitation to help members gain experience, but others worried this might lower attendance. A rotating facilitator system was considered to balance participation and budget concerns.  As the meeting ended, We focused on budget adjustments, clearer documentation, and the upcoming Town Hall for further discussions.",

The database should be the 'source of truth', so André has created scripts to track the differences so they can be corrected. See https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/249   This also gives a way to see what kinds of things tend to get corrected when auditing summaries. Some are minor proofreading or formatting corrections, which are not  significant in terms of meaning; but others are factual or structural changes, which likely *would* affect how a graph RAG determines meaning. So we noted that it is useful to have these differences visible, for reference and to be able to see what kinds of things got corrected - so we will save these data examples to a repo for future reference.  We also noted that of course this auditing process will no longer be done in Q2, because we have decided to NOT correct meeting summaries at all in Q2 as an experiment.  We may find that using a graph-based process to interrogate the Archives will mean that most of the errors that people make in summaries do not matter much, and the graph process will still enable us to extract meaning even if people are not confident documenters, and our uncorrected summaries are factually inaccurate (as many of them are). So by the end of Q2 2025, we will want to check whether we see any substantial difference between Q2 data (which will be uncorrected) and the rest of the Archives. If we *don't* see this, however, then being able to see the kinds of corrections that were made in previous Quarters will be useful.",

We have agreed on minimal editing of the controlled vocab - we're only removing obvious duplicates and misspellings - because we don't want to overdetermine similarity. Two tags that appear superficially similar might have very different connotations for the individual who created them - so we will try to preserve those differences, and see what a graph RAG process makes of it.  We noted that this lays the groundwork for what can be analysed later, using techniques such as proximity, semantic similarity, rarity of a tag, and co-occurence of tags (for example if a particular person's name/presence in a meeting is often correlated with a particular emotion tag, such as 'organised'). Also we noted that, particularly with negative emotions, the fact that a meeting was not tagged with a particular emotion doesn't necessarily mean that the emotion wasn't there - often, a problem needs to become really severe before someone will tag a summary with (for example) 'aggressive' or 'silencing', and there could be a buildup over several (untagged) meetings which led to it. Subject to funding, we could use our tag taxonomy as a basis for future community analysis of the topology of emotions and topics that has been identified in meetings.  There is also an ethical dimension to this - asking 'is AI drawing the correct conclusions?' and giving the community some ownership of the conclusions that are drawn  - which we will be able to examine.",

Yes, all have been approved. - African Guild: 11 consent, 2 object, 3 abstain. - AI Sandbox/Think Tank: 13 consent, 0 object, 3 abstain. - Education: 11 consent, 1 object, 4 abstain. - Marketing: 9 consent, 1 object, 6 abstain. - R&D: 11 consent, 2 object, 3 abstain. - Writers: 10 consent, 1 object, 5 abstain.  Wr noted, however, that several of those who abstained/objected didn't comment to say why; and we noted a fairly high number of abstentions. Are people abstaining because they see it as a 'soft' way to register an objection? Or because they are not anonymous? Tevo noted in Chat that he abstained to 'all where I saw progress in reporting and budget, but was not quite yet harmless'.  3) COMMENTS RAISED IN THE 2nd-ROUND CONSENT FORMS We read through the consent forms, and noted 1) which objections from Round 1 people had said were still an issue, and 2) all the comments.  There were severa l concerns that were about how people write their reports and budgets. We wondered whether there is a need for some sessions that look at this, and if so, whether Governance is the right place for it; but we didn't reach a conclusion.  4) HOW WILL WE TRACK THE CONCERNS RAISED? Some of them may need further discussion, and/or for the WG concerned to take action. We decided how to address these issues so they are not forgotten about (see 'decisions' below).  We also noted that: - Tevo can use PowerBI as usual to give stats and insights on the consent process;  - Guillermo could in the long term try to develop his planned Consent Process dashboard to help us track issues raised in the consent process; although this would be difficult at present, because low token price means the scope of that project can't easily be extended.",

        "narrative": "Peter reviewed the objections that were discussed in the last meeting, noting that some may need further discussion before moving to the consent process.   Guillermo talked about the importance of not delaying decisions because the objector is not present. Vani noted that we have already started moving with or without Tevo being present.  Peter highlighted the questions asked in the last meeting: - Whether to consolidate objections or keep them separate in the consent form? - Can we, in a governance meeting, deem a particular objection invalid ?  Lordkizzy presented that André has withdrawn his objection to AI Sandbox/Thnk Tank. We agreed to ask André to add a note in the Responses spreadsheet tp say this, and he did so during the meeting.  Vani asked what we plan to do if a workgroup doesn't get the required 80% consent in the 2nd round. We agreed that the workgroup should be able to continue to try to reach a resolution, rather than simply having no budget for Q2. Lord kizzy noted that we should track the objections to know which has been addressed and which has not.  Guillermo spoke that we shouldn't consolidate all the objections on a WG in the form, as it will make it difficult to be clear what someone is actually objecting to  Lord kizzy suggested that we should add a question in the form that asks 'Overall, do you consent to this WG's budget?' and then ask which, if any, of the objections from round 1 are still a concern. This would allow people to indicate if certain objections had not been satisfactorily addressed, even if on balance they consent to the WG's budget overall.  There was a brief discussion on workgroup autonomy, in relation to the objection to African Guild's charging $25 for facilitation when the objector felt that $20 was standard. Many felt that such objections interfered with workgroup autonomy; and it was noted that there is not actually any agreed 'standard' price. Nevertheless, we agreed not to ruke the objection as invalid, but to let it go to the 2nd-round consent process.  Clement raised concerns about the objection to African Guild in relation to reward distribution; he questioned whether it is true that rewards were being allocated solely based on meeting attendance rather than task performance and noted that token price fluctuations were limiting workgroup innovation.  Peter expressed caution about spending reserves when token prices are low, the idea of using reserves to support workgroup functions during downturns was tabled for another discussion.   We discussed exactly what the '80-20% rule' means, and how we calculate whether a WG has passed the threshold - do they need 80% consent or above 80%? or is it better to look at the threshold as 'no more than 20% objection'? And 80%/20% of what? Is it all those who participated, or are abstainers not counted? See 'Decisions' below.",

        "discussion": "PRIORITIES AND BUDGET CONSTRAINTS We discussed possible collaborations with spin-offs and other partners and how to deal with the current token prices which is at $0.16 today, half of what we calculated Q2 budget at. We considered different WGs past and intended collaborations, and Guillermo proposed that in future, we'd need to create a strategy that takes account of the effects of market price. We came to the conclusion that everyone - spin-offs included - will be affected by the low token price. We also had discussions on who we have to reach out first in the program.  PRODUCT IDENTITY AND METHODOLOGIES  We discussed various technical tools created by the workgroups and we thought of having to create different approach and methodologies on the tools created (We considered the idea of developing new approaches and methodologies for how these tools are used or improved). We also thought of how we can package that to share it with spin-offs and make it something that is to their advantage to use. We talked about having an independent research to look at different spin-offs that we have in the ecosystem and we'll add a page to the current 'Workgroups >< wider ecosystem collaborations' spreadsheet that outlines what we offer, which workgroup is it? What piece of tooling is it? And why a partner might need it. We decided to postpone the discussion on conducting independent research until more people have had the chance to share their input.   ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW AND WORKGROUP COORDINATION  We emphasized the importance of understanding the needs of spin-offs and partners who we are offering our products too. We proposed a structured approach to document what each workgroup has built or made and what they could offer to their partners. We talked about the specific offerings that each Workgroup can offer to the ecosystem and we suggested forming a task force to streamline the process and the group will have a discussion on the next steps for outreach based on the compiled information.  PROJECTS AND COLLABORATION STRATEGIES  We noted that there are a number of ongoing collaborations, and we decided to actively promote collaboration through targeted outreach, and during the meeting, we outlined the projects each workgroup is involved in, along with their current partnerships.  Tevo shared his perspective on the role of his workgroups, emphasizing that it's not just about offering tools or seeking direct collaborations with spin-offs. Instead, he sees value in co-developing experimental approaches to decentralization - an iterative process that adapts to emerging needs. He noted in the chat, 'I still find my work to be relevant for improving decentralized autonomy and governance... but it's unclear if SNET still pursues this path openly.' Drawing on past experience, he referenced the Catalyst Governance Guild's early involvement in the Ambassador Program as an example of this experimental mindset, where the goal wasn't to push fixed solutions but to stay responsive and adaptive. Effiom added to this by pointing out that beyond tools, the real asset lies in the skills and capabilities people bring to the table.  We noted that if any of the spin-offs start thinking about launching a product, we'd be there to support them.  Peter highlighted the alignment of various spin-offs with decentralization and the significance of community involvement (He noted that this shared foundation is encouraging, but also pointed out that each spin-off may have its own approach, so alignment isn't guaranteed). The meeting wrapped up with reminders for Governance and Town-hall calls, alongside an invitation for participants to enter their workgroup information into the spreadsheet.",

        "narrative": "Main topic of the meeting was the overall negative effects of low token price on the work of the group.  We went through our GitHub Board https://github.com/orgs/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/projects/1/views/2, starting with issues 'In Progress', and then 'To Do'.   Many of the In Progress tasks are for transcription of research interviews, and are likely to be completed soon. However, due to low token price, we agreed that we will hold off from paying them for now, as this would use up all of our Q2 2025 budget (because budgets were calculated at $0.30, and token price is currently $0.16). Vani has DMed all those working on transcription, and they are all OK with waiting for payment.    We noted that technically, the WG went over budget at the end of Q1, due to an unexpected further price drop on the day we were paying out outstanding tasks. Vani has discussed this with Tevo in the Treasury Discord channel, arguing that when token price is falling, it matters less which Quarter a task was funded in, because a WG might need to dip into its reserves in order to pay for tasks from times when token price was higher. So when assessing if a WG is 'in the red', we should look at the WG's *cumulative* budget, including any reserves - which means that this WG *isn't* over budget overall, if we count its reserves and its Q2 2025 allocation.   RE: outstanding tasks from previous Quarters, we noted that due to the nature of this WG, tasks have often involved a steep learning curve (such as interviewing), so it's understandable that people have taken considerably longer than expected to complete their work. Unless we decide in future to pay tasks in advance if token price is high, even if the task is not completed yet, there's little that can be done to mitigate this - we need to allow people time to learn and to get to grips with complex tasks. Nevertheless, we agreed that we do need to close interviewing and survey-sharing tasks from Q4 that are still outstanding.   (We briefly discussed the idea of either paying core tasks in advance, if we know they will definitely be done, or converting the money for them to a stablecoin - but we didn't draw a conclusion on this. We will raise it in the forthcoming Governance WG session on responses to low token price.)  We then decided which as-yet-unpaid tasks from Q1 2025 will be paid as soon as the new allocation for Q2 is added to the Treasury dashboard, and which will have to wait.  We noted that we need to do some fairly drastic budget fitting for Q2 due to low token price, so we agreed on where those cuts will be made - see the fitted Q2 budget in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vLC4ZIHO3WN-Ah9XwehRmbwLZAeePsxxYQXmLiiJLnQ/edit?usp=sharing  We ended with a mention of the current BGI Nexus funding round, for proposals using AI for social good. There are 5 proposals by people from the Ambassador Program, so we encouraged people to vote. We noted that they are using an interesting 'pairwise voting' process, where voters are presented with randomised pairs of proposals and must select their favourite of the 2.",

He announced that the Twitter premium plan had been activated and that the monthly Town Hall updates from January would be the first publication on X. Furthermore, Kenichi stated that the Web3 publishing platforms required additional attention and, to that end, requested that Cj Frankie and Gorga submit their first drafts.  DRAFTs: As agreed in the previous meeting, article suggestions will now be submitted via spreadsheet. In this meeting, Kenichi demonstrated the new writer's draft submission form, which streamlines the process. Writers can now suggest articles, include submission and preferred publication dates, and provide other relevant information. The form's integration with a Google Sheet simplifies tracking for the workgroup. Ines also recommended considering tools like Trello to further enhance workflow. In response to a question from Lady Tempestt, Kenichi confirmed that both writers and scribes will have access to the submission form. Once a draft is approved, the scribes will submit it to the community page. Kenichi will coordinate with Peter to pin the form link to the writer's channel for easy access.  Role document: Ines inquired about the new role document and its associated thresholds. Kenichi clarified that the document would be accessible this quarter and that there would be no penalties for not meeting any outlined expectations. He explained that the document's purpose is to track Scribblers' progress over time, enabling the workgroup to make informed decisions, such as whether or not to onboard new members.  Ambassador program website: In this meeting, Ines proposed the idea of creating a platform or WordPress for the workgroup, where all information about what we do can be easily accessed! Kenichi then revealed that he is collaborating with the R&D guild to develop an ambassador program website. This site will house comprehensive information about all participating workgroups, each of which will have its dedicated page with updated access.",

          "Introduction of New member: The discussion began with a warm greeting from Ayo. Zainab shared her experiences around the program and also introduce herself. Marttinsoki apologized for submitting the Meeting Summary note late.",
          "Q1 Retrospective Discussion: LordKizzy highlighted the Guilds achievements but pointed out communication gaps with other guilds and workgroups. He stressed the importance of increasing awareness of the content calendar and the Ambassador program's processes. CJFrankie raised concerns about the ambassador program's effectiveness, suggesting a reduction in meetings and a focus on marketing initiatives. He emphasized the importance of community engagement through events and branded merchandise to raise awareness. CJFrankie also mentioned the potential for fundraising efforts, such as GoFundMe, to support these initiatives. Kareem emphasized the need for the Marketing Guild to create greater awareness about SingularityNet and its projects, arguing that current activities are too meeting-centric with limited outcomes. He suggested leveraging trends in the Web3 space for relevant content creation. Ayo questioned the implementation of marketing strategies, particularly regarding the roles of writers and video workgroups, while also noting that the ambassador program may not fully recognize its marketing responsibilities. Kareem suggested that the Ambassador Program might adopt new practices based on his experience. LordKizzy pointed out that the program's fixed allocation in agents creates challenges, particularly when the token price fluctuates, impacting the overall effectiveness of the program. He noted the absence of a supervisory council to address these issues and mentioned that many guilds are struggling due to the current funding structure.",
          "Q2 Budget Discussion: LordKizzy pointed out the concerning low participation in a recent consent form from marketing guild members, which raises questions about engagement and involvement in critical decisions. He also mentioned that there are still some objections that need to be addressed, with the first one being related to the Zealy initiative. LordKizzy provided clarity on the Zealy Initiative and Zealy Impact. LordKizzy discussed the marketing group's budget for Q1 2025, revealing that expenses exceeded the planned budget by $1,100. He emphasized the difficulties arising from the low token price, which affects the distribution of rewards to the core/task force members and the execution of various initiatives. A proposal was made to revert to previous allocation rates to manage the financial strain. Kenichi highlighted ongoing issues with Zealy participants not receiving their rewards, while LordKizzy pointed out the lack of a public announcement detailing who was to be rewarded. LordKizzy stated that payments had been made twice, but confusion over account verification and duplicate names complicated the process. Both speakers agreed on the need for clearer communication and a more organized approach to reward distribution. Ayo called for finalizing the governance document to improve decision-making and budgeting processes, and Martisoki was encouraged to gather action items for review in the next meeting, with a reminder for Guild members to arrive early for enhanced productivity."

          "Ayo kicked off the Marketing Guild call, welcoming attendees. Noticing the low turnout, he considered holding off a bit to see if more members would join. He encouraged everyone to show up a little earlier for future meetings.",
          "Review of Action Items and Governance Document Discussion: Ayo led a review of the action items from the previous meeting, confirming that while some tasks had been completed, others remained outstanding. LordKizzy noted that there had been no response to a proposed call with representatives from the writers and marketing groups. Ayo emphasized the importance of reviewing the governance document and encouraged all present members to actively participate in the discussion.",
          "Attendance Policy Discussion: Ayo brought up concerns regarding the attendance policy, particularly the rule imposing penalties on members who miss four consecutive meetings. Lordkizzy clarified that core members are expected to attend and engage actively, with consequences for missing more than two meetings within a single month. Peter questioned the significance of the distinction between consecutive and monthly absences, suggesting that the proposed penalties might need reconsideration.",
          "Governance Discussions and Attendance Metrics: Ayo initiated a conversation around the governance documents, suggesting that if consensus couldn't be reached, a dedicated focus group could be formed to conduct a thorough review. Photogee raised concerns about using attendance as a primary performance metric, arguing that it doesn't necessarily reflect the value or impact of members' contributions. Ayo acknowledged the difficulties in the current decision-making process and invited suggestions on how to enhance member commitment and encourage more consistent feedback. Kenichi emphasized the importance of developing a living governance document-one that evolves alongside the guild's goals and incorporates community input through tools like Discord polls. He proposed that any modifications to the document be put to a vote, ensuring transparency and collaborative decision-making. Ayo raised the question of whether to move forward with the current version or integrate suggested changes, stressing the need for clarity in how such decisions are made. Ayo spoke on the importance of commitment within the Marketing Guild, emphasizing that the guild's vitality depends on consistent, active participation-not just maintaining a channel. He noted the lack of recent discussion around the Governance Document and proposed three potential paths forward: moving ahead with the current version, continuing broader discussions, or forming a focus group for deeper evaluation. Ayo also addressed concerns related to payment decisions, highlighting their possible influence on member performance and engagement. Ayo highlighted how late arrivals disrupt meeting flow and urged members to inform the group in advance if they're unable to attend. Lordkizzy echoed the importance of regular meetings for maintaining accountability, noting that they foster direct communication and help clarify each member's level of commitment. He also observed that past efforts to engage members outside of scheduled meetings had proven less effective. Kenichi raised concerns about the current governance process and proposed improvements to the voting documentation, suggesting Discord as a platform for better tracking and transparency. Ayo welcomed the suggestions and reiterated the importance of punctuality to ensure productive discussions during meetings. He also emphasized the value of gathering input from members who are unable to attend, to ensure broader participation in decision-making. Lordkizzy opened a discussion on Peter's document, emphasizing its importance and the need to cover key topics such as attendance policies and budget planning. He presented a spreadsheet detailing current collaborations and encouraged members to contribute ideas to strengthen marketing efforts. Kenichi recommended raising awareness for guild projects and proposed the creation of dedicated funding pools to support targeted initiatives."

          "Quorum Discussion and Updates: The discussion centered on the importance of establishing a quorum for future meetings, noting that sessions with low attendance risk being unproductive. Martinsoki suggested setting a minimum attendance threshold to determine whether meetings should proceed-a proposal that was well-received by others. Acknowledging that they currently lacked quorum, the group debated whether to continue or postpone the meeting. Members were encouraged to share updates that didn't require consensus, underscoring the need for clearer attendance and decision-making protocols going forward.",
          "Updates on Proposals and Budget Discussion: Lordkizzy shared updates from his conversations with Kenichi regarding the Zealy project, with EricDavies noting the lack of feedback on the proposal. He emphasized the importance of clearly defining the graphics team's responsibilities, with some input from CJFrankie expected next week. Lordkizzy also stressed the need to adjust Q2 rewards in light of the current token price.",
          "Updates on Twitter Spaces Document: Kenichi discussed a document he is developing to support the creation of Twitter databases, which he believes will aid growth efforts, despite facing technical difficulties. He proposed leveraging Twitter spaces to enhance the visibility of the Singularity Ambassador program and engage a wider audience.",
          "Updates on Governance document: Ese Williams raised concerns about unpaid payments for Eric Davies and Photogee, suggesting a separate call to address the issue. Ayo noted the difficulty of making decisions without a quorum, emphasizing the need to adopt formal governance documents. The discussion also highlighted the importance of improving communication and collaboration within the Marketing Guild. Discussion on Core Member Rewards and Deliverables: Ayo emphasized the need to define core member value before addressing reward adjustments. Kareem noted that reduced funding for the graphics team would require scaled-back deliverables across all teams. Discussion on Attendance, Rewards, and Quorum: The discussion focused on the importance of establishing a quorum for meetings, especially as attendance has declined due to reduced rewards. Concerns were raised about how the current token price limits fair reward distribution. Suggestions included adjusting the number of members and how rewards are allocated to address past complaints."

          "Introduction of New member: The discussion began with a warm greeting from LordKizzy. Lordkizzy addressed the group regarding the Unix testers onboarding form, noting complications with the Unix team's email communication. He urged participants to complete the onboarding form for NuNet appliances. He also gave reminders about the ASI form shared in a previous town hall.",
          "Intellectual Property and AI Ethics Discussion: The session, led by Lordkizzy, focused on the intersection of intellectual property and AI ethics, fostering open dialogue among participants. Key concepts associated with AI ethics-such as equity, fairness, and responsibility-were highlighted by Advance and Gorga. The group participated in a poll on whether AI models should hold intellectual property rights for their generated content, which yielded a range of differing opinions. Discussion on AI Ownership and Intellectual Property Rights: The conversation further explored the issue of AI ownership and intellectual property rights, some participants argued that such rights should belong to the humans who create and operate AI systems, emphasizing that AI lacks agency and intent. Gorga added that ownership implies emotional and social dimensions-qualities machines do not possess. Discussion on Credit Attribution in AI Development: The group expressed varied perspectives on the legal and ethical implications of AI-generated content. Advanceameyaw emphasized the importance of proper credit attribution in AI development. He noted that while AI models like ChatGPT often receive significant public attention, the contributions of the developers behind these technologies frequently go unrecognized. LordKizzy agreed that credit should be context-dependent, taking into account the roles of both developers and data owners in the success of AI systems. Discussion on AI Creation and Ownership: Lordkizzy led the conversation into the philosophical dimensions of AI as a product of human creation, with its roots traced back to divine creation. The ownership of AI outputs and the broader implications of AI's existence in relation to God were debated. Lordkizzy acknowledged the complexity of the topic and invited further contributions from other participants in the conference room to continue the discussion. Exploring the Value of AI in Creative Works: Advanceameyaw articulated the distinction between human creativity and AI, suggesting that while human work is authentic, AI operates through simulation. CollyPride added that the embodiment of AI in robotics could help bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world applications. Lordkizzy supported the idea that AI-generated art should not be viewed as less valuable than human-created art, as both forms can contribute meaningfully to the creative landscape. Consequences of Assigning Rights to AI: The conversation, initiated by Lordkizzy, centered on the potential consequences of granting rights to AI, particularly in relation to intellectual property. Concerns were raised by a participant regarding the autonomy of AI without human oversight and the necessity of a universal reputation system to ensure accountability. Lordkizzy highlighted the challenge of determining responsibility for AI's actions, stressing the need for clearer legal frameworks and enforcement mechanisms."

Before we got into the main agenda, he had a quick chat with us about the current drop in AGIX price and how we don't have any reserves to fall back on at the moment. We also went over the summary notes from the last meeting, it was great but a few corrections were spotted and sorted out.  Budget and Budgeting: Duke shared that our budget has been approved, but the AGIX price drop is becoming a real concern. He mentioned that last quarter we got 9,500 AGIX, which was around 5,220 USD and because of the token price, we're working with just 2,850 USD this quarter at the same 9,500 AGIX, noting that it's way below what we were hoping for.  Budget Discussion: We had a quick discussion on how to move forward this quarter with the current AGIX market price. Duke mentioned that we're already on biweekly meetings, which aren't as effective as weekly ones. Monthly meetings were also mentioned but was not considered   CJ brought up a suggestion from the Writer Workgroup. He shared that they've started paying in AGIX instead of USD and have cut out some of the more interesting and interactive tasks to stay within budget. Duke acknowledged it as a good idea, but also pointed out that this method pushes the risk of price fluctuations onto individuals.  Pending Tasks: Duke also reminded us that we still have some unpaid tasks from Q1 that, we initially agreed to hold off on payments until AGIX went back up, but here we are in a new quarter, and the token price is still down. If we decide to pay out now, it'll eat way into out Q2 budget   We suggested four possible options to handle this: 1. Pay all pending tasks now and work with whatever is left. 2. Pay only half of the amount owed. 3. Pay the pending tasks in USD and new ones in AGIX. 4. Pay out everything in AGIX.  Duke stressed the need for some quick math and budget readjustments. To move forward, an urgent focus group meeting will be held, and it's open to anyone interested in being part of the discussion.",

        "narrative": "Kick-off: The writers' workgroup weekly meeting commenced at 3:10 p.m. Kenichi reviewed the action items from the previous meeting. He announced that the Twitter premium plan had been activated and that the monthly Town Hall updates from January would be the first publication on X. Furthermore, he stated that the Web3 publishing platforms require additional attention and, to that end, requested that Cj Frankie and Gorga submit their first drafts.  DRAFTS: As agreed in the previous meeting, article suggestions will now be submitted via spreadsheet. In this meeting, Kenichi demonstrated the new draft submission form, which streamlines the process. Writers can now suggest articles, include submission and preferred publication dates, and provide other relevant information. The form's integration with a Google Sheet simplifies tracking for the workgroup. Ines also recommended considering tools like Trello to further enhance workflow. Both Scribblers and Scribes will have access to the submission form. Once a draft is approved, the Scribes will submit it to the community page. Kenichi will coordinate with Peter to pin the form link to the WWG Discord channel for easy access.  Role document: Ines inquired about the new role document and its associated thresholds. Kenichi clarified that the document will be accessible this Quarter, and there will be no penalties for not meeting any outlined expectations. The document's purpose is to track Scribblers' progress over time, enabling the workgroup to make informed decisions, such as whether or not to onboard new members.  Ambassador Program website: In this meeting, Ines proposed the idea of creating a platform or WordPress for the workgroup, where all information about what we do can be easily accessed. Kenichi then revealed that he is collaborating with the R&D guild to develop an Ambassador Program website, which will house comprehensive information about all workgroups, each of which will have a dedicated page with updated access.",

        "narrative": "Are 'high-cost individuals' are earning too much?  First, we noted that we could call them something less pejorative, such as 'high-contributing individuals', since those who earn the most are generally those who contribute the most. We also noted that the reason that many of them contribute more seems to be that they feel some sense of accountability and an obligation to deliver something.   Key points raised:  - Are some 'high earners' doing too many *roles* within workgroups, rather than tasks, with insufficient clarity on what work their role covers, or the time they are spending? Or roles that others are restricted from doing? If so, is this an abuse of the system? - For some tasks, only a few people have the skills to do them, so others can't take those tasks on. - Are 'high contributing individuals' actually preventing anyone from taking tasks? Or if they stepped down, would we find that nobody else would step up?  We noted that the high contributors often do try to share the work, but to no avail, as others are unwilling to take tasks - do we need to explore why that is? - On the above, how can we hear from 'lower earners' in the Program to find out whether they do feel blocked from taking on tasks? We might be making assumptions about how they experience things. - If we implement a cap, it might not necessarily be on the total an individual can earn, but on how much an individual can earn from a particular workgroup, or how much a workgroup, or the program as a whole, can spend on a particular type of task. - Should a cap on earnings only come into play when the AGIX exchange rate falls below a certain level? - Would a cap on earnings create a cultiure of volunteerism, and an atmosphere where people don't feel able to expect to be paid something for the work they do? Would it be more ethical to just say 'if you do the work, you should be paid for it'? - Would an earnings cap encourage people to be more selective on the tasks they do - e.g. NOT do a task if it is taking too much time, or be more innovative with using tools and automations? - Are there tasks being done just for the sake of getting paid, that do not really need to be done?  We didn't agree on implementing an earnings cap now - but we did agree it should be discussed further, and in the light of considering what kinds of tasks we reward, and whether a contribution is of value to the Ambassador Program or not. People shouldn't be rewarded simply for doing things, but for doing things that are deemed to be of value - and we noted that the community as a whole gets to determine what types of activities it considers to be of value and worth rewarding; so this is a conversation we need to have.  We discussed what we mean by 'contribution' and 'participation', and the difference between them. For example, we currently log 'participation' by recording who was present in a meeting - but sitting passively in meetings is arguably not a meaningful 'contribution'. Can we reward more imaginatively? - for example, rewards for those who (whether verbally or in Chat) say something that makes others think, or those who contribute an opinion. And do we need a category for 'attendance' rather than calling it either 'contribution' OR 'participation'? We also wondered about ways of recording micro-contributions that are too small to track but which can add up to a lot; contributions that are not about specific, finite tasks, but are more general; and particularly, voluntary contributions. We drew no firm conclusions on this.   We noted that some 'higher earners' appear to be doing more hours for their rewards than others - but we realised this is partly due to how tasks are recorded on Dework. It emerged that not everyone logs 'task points' (the equivalent of 'hours spent') on Dework - sometimes because they don't know how long the person took and it would be too vague of an estimate to be of any value as data, and sometimes because they question whether 'amount of time spent' is a valid measure.  Some in the meeting felt that time-based tracking **is** meaningful, since it is a data-point that we can at least measure; others argued that there's too much potential for it to be misleading. For example,  - if someone is new, they take longer to do a task, but that doesn't make their contribution worth more;  - some people tend to do tasks that are more time-consuming, but that doesn't mean their contribution to the ecosystem is more valuable than that of people who tend to focus on quick tasks;  - if someone is by nature a slow/fast worker, should we pay them more/less?;  - neurodivergent people might do tasks quicker than average due to hyperfocus, or slower than average due to executive function issues, and it can feel exposing to be asked to assess your work as if you were working in a neurotypical way when you're not.  Overall it might not be helpful to scrutinise time, and it isn't always a very valid measure of how much someone is contributing. Task-based rather than time-based measurement might be better.  We also looked at the taxonomy that is used to categorise the *type* of task in the Treasury system. Different workgroups use different names for tasks that are actually similar, which can skew any assessment of what we are paying the most for and spending the most time on. We agreed that this taxonomy might need some looking at, but it's a big task, and we didn't determine who will have the capacity to do it.",

He proposed that the idea be discussed further with the Focus Group before making a final decision. CJFrankie supported the idea, suggesting that we hold meetings on the first Thursday of every month to help cut down on costs, especially given the unfavorable token rates. However, Advance expressed concerns about this change, emphasizing that bi-weekly meetings help maintain momentum and keep the workgroup effective. While he acknowledged that monthly meetings might ease the budget strain, he felt we should stick to the bi-weekly schedule if it's still feasible.    Highlights / Upcoming events Clement shared details about the upcoming Afro AI Multilingual Workshop in Nigeria, organized through the Education Initiative. This is the second phase of the workshop, and this time, the content will be translated into Hausa. Clement believes this approach will not only make the material more accessible but also encourage more people to learn the language. The workshop will spotlight African innovators and incorporate storytelling to foster deeper local engagement. Advance asked concerning communication around brand guidelines for flyer design and marketing support for post scheduling. If needed, the marketing team will assist with flyer design upon Clement's request, but he added that he will first check with Kizzy for clarity.   AOB: Advance asked about the next steps for the Research on Indigenous AI tools for Africans. Clement explained that while there were plans to continue, the Guild has put things on hold for now because of the current AGIX token price. They're hoping to pick it back up once the price improves.   The meeting wrapped up with Clement promising to share the storyline documents used in the Afro AI Multilingual Workshop via the Discord channel.",

        "narrative": "Narrative: During the meeting we discussed several important topics: Budget submission deadlines for workgroups because only six out of twenty-one groups submitted their information as it is. We need inputs from other WG to complete the form to enable the Q3 Budget progress to its final stage.   A key arouse around What should be the new deadline for workgroups to submit their budget information, in order to have others complete their form there will be need for a deadline to be announced on WGs that are yet to complete the form.   After several discussions there was an agreed date set for the Deadline which is on Tuesday 2oth May at 14UTC and any WG that failed to do so, we will assume they are okay with their current Budget cap for Q3.  Token minting and its impact on budget allocations: Furthermore there was a brief breakdown on the adjustment of the AGIX token minting plan which was carried out by Peter Concerning  the whole proposal here is. He pointed out that  back in 2021, there was a plan to increase the circulating supply of AGIX tokens with 100%. So it used to be 1 billion and this proposal turned it into 2 billion. And the very first edition of this proposal included minting these tokens over five years total. And this was changed by community suggestion, by Jan Horlinks actually, to shift it over to 91 years in total. He went further to explain that there is a slow decline in minting over 91 years rather than a total halt in 2026. He pointed out that from the beginning of minting in 2021, the price of tokens has risen dramatically, offsetting the decline in the number of tokens produced. He added that a recent vote had approved giving the foundation 100 million tokens to be used for hardware acquisitions. With this piece of information a lot of members in this meeting understood the reason behind the budget cap and the reductions of 1.5% for every quarter.   Consent Process and Q3 Dates Discussion: (i.e. to check in the room on whether everybody thinks Tuesday is okay as a deadline)? After a closer look on what we have covered in this meeting, We all consent to the date which is Tuesday to be a meeting with the agenda of Discussing the Consent Process and Q3 Dates.  Participation and engagement in budget discussions: According to the the last run of the Anonymity consent process which was found not chaotic, a suggestion was raised regarding the upcoming Anonymity to have a survey to see if there are others will like to share their opinion on some of the budget proposals but doubt if they will if it's not going to be Anonymous they might just decide not to share. While others suggest going back to the old ways with a point of others using the Anonymity process to consent multiple times without anyone knowing. Someone raised a suggestion in the past of putting on something  like the Swarm account or some other account and then appoint one person who can see to it and that person is also not dependent on funding that at the end the column for members Discord name and email address will not be seen and having those that can verity.  While the others who is so there's only one person who can see it in that case it would be Tevo but you know we could create a whole new account just for this that only one person one trusted person can see it could be you Peter somebody who's kind of not dependent on funding is therefore not engaged and then when we share it we just delete the columns that give the person person's Discord name and email address, but we have those so that we can verify.   Structure and implications of the consent process: An issue was raised on WG whose members don't show concern to consenting on their workgroup looking at the number of members but with little ratio when it comes to consenting and that having 60 Core contributors, what will be the Quorum for that. There was an agreement to this concerning using a Quorum in that way WG will have the responsibility to task members to approve their proposal. Someone added that in scenarios where WG members feel the whole proposal thing has been rushed by their leaders and they are not sure and feeling uneasy to speak up in the WG, they can say so by not consenting. Discussion on Upcoming Consent Round and Participation Issues  There was an addition also in preparation for the upcoming consent round, the need for an anonymous feedback form and the potential for a session to guide participants on its use and someone will have to overlook and gather feedback on quorum and anonymity in a town hall or Discord to ensure clarity among participants due to low participation rates and expressed the need for asynchronous input options.  The meeting ended on a positive and lighthearted note, while we all expressed optimism about getting WG members to consent and introducing a Quorum or not.",

        "narrative": "FUNDS ALLOCATION AND RESPONSE TO LOW TOKEN PRICE. Tevo expressed concerns about some workgroups' unclear spending priorities and compared it to his own experience with treasury automation, where he was surprised by the funding allocation. Peter questioned why certain workgroups were billing $50 per hour instead of the expected $20, though he acknowledged the higher rate might be justified depending on the workgroup. Tevo also noted the lack of clarity in how rewards are tied to attendance, suggesting more details might come in a future proposal. Vani shared a Miroboard to address the low token price, allowing team members to vote on ideas and identify actionable next steps.   SUPPORTING WORKGROUPS IN OFFERING THEIR TOOLS AS A SERVICE AND TASK FORCE FORMATION. In previous calls, we discussed workgroups' collaboration with partners and spin-offs, and the tools they offer. A suggestion was made to form a task force to explore marketing these tools to spin-offs. We also talked about increasing funding by helping workgroups seek alternative streams and proposed a sign-up sheet for workgroups interested in joining projects or needing funding for existing tools. Emphasis was placed on prioritizing quality over quantity and having focused conversations on which initiatives to support. We agreed to pause further action until the next governance workgroup call. Lastly, we explored how to support workgroups in presenting their ideas, whether through DeepFunding, RFPs, spin-offs, or related operations, as part of the planned task force.   AUTOMATION AND MEETING FREQUENCY  Concerns were raised about the current research and development phase of many tools, with automation seen as a way to enhance existing processes, not just innovate. Translation automation was discussed, but concerns about quality and onboarding remain. The recent move to GitHub was viewed positively. The Process Guild supports broader automation efforts, though full implementation will require time and resources. There's interest in further exploration next quarter, potentially through a formal proposal. Emphasis was placed on understanding the impact and avoiding workload concentration on a few individuals. Regarding meeting reduction, most workgroups have already reduced meetings, with positive examples like the AI Ethics group (see to AI Ethics Q4 report in the working docs). It was suggested that workgroups share reflections on how this has affected their work to inform future planning.   PAYMENT STRUCTURES AND BUDGET CAPS Tevo noted that tasks in the African guild are sometimes prepaid, particularly during busy periods like holidays, which can be efficient but may lead to issues, such as mistakenly paying for meetings that haven't occurred yet. We acknowledged that while no one is actively preventing prepayments, errors can arise when schedules are confused. A concern was raised about the impact of token price fluctuations, especially for workers paid in tokens like AGIX, with some questioning whether workers should bear the risk of price drops. A suggestion to prepay when token prices are high was discussed, though it was noted that workers would still have to manage the timing of token sales. We agreed that tasks with more certainty, like group meetings, could be prepaid, but it would depend on the task and the commitment involved. Duke suggested hedging in USD to avoid token price risks, but there were concerns about the program's ability to handle this complexity. Ultimately, it was decided that workers could hedge independently after receiving payment, but the program wouldn't take on the responsibility of converting payments to stablecoins or USD.   LEGAL CONTRACTS AND TASK BASED COMPENSATION We discussed managing funds and contracts, particularly the costs of establishing a legal framework for payments in anything other than. AGIX (paying in USD or converting to a stable coin). Initial legal service estimates are around $1,000, but there's uncertainty about whether the SingularityNET Foundation can sign contracts for fund custody. The group plans to reach out to the foundation for clarification and follow up with a lawyer on potential costs. A suggestion was made to raise awareness among workgroups about paying for tasks in advance, especially when future prices might increase. The conversation also touched on the impact of reward volatility on income, with the idea of addressing this through a governance session and survey. Lastly, we considered setting a budget cap for rewards per person to prevent overpayments, with flexibility for exceptions in cases requiring specialized skills. We also agreed that this topic should not be publicly discussed in the next Townhall meeting to avoid privacy problems, and it was confirmed that this item would be addressed in an upcoming governance call happening on Thursday 1st of May.",

        "narrative": "Action Items from the last meeting  How do we determine the absolute bare minimum budget that each WG/Guild needs? A minimum budget could be like a next step up for new ideas before it becomes an actual workgroup; one issue here is that the minimum budget for one workgroup might be different for another. For example, 5000AGIX as the minimum budget for one WG is like on the high side and a full budget allocation for another WG/Guild whose minimum budget is about 1500AGIX. Are there any specific challenges or successes in determining the minimum budget? - A few workgroups have had to create a new budget sheet; cut their rewards by 50 percent to do almost the same work they've been doing, and added extra task to the work they have to do with 50% reduction in rewards; they have had to go for monthly meetings, and no meetings while working async. They had to pick up the most critical task(which could be 1 or 2) and carry over the rest to the next quarter. - We noted that high token price paves ways for people to try different things that relates to the main purpose of their WG/Guild but that with this low token price a lot of people have had to think critically and focus only on priorities in their respective WGs/Guilds' which isn't exactly ideal because then there is no room for exploring new ideas. Most WGs/Guilds are prioritizing based on importance or need. - We've also noticed that monthly meetings and async coordination is not exactly the budget save we think it is because most times there is always a need for an Async support role which would still cost money. In few cases where there is a constant task with a flat fee no matter the token price, much saving can not be done there. - We also noticed that some WGs are relatively safe; they almost do not need more funds; they had fewer meetings which resulted in low engagement levels in their WGs; most of their work turned into an automated process so it needed less maintenance and update.  - We noted that in some WGs while it is cheaper to maintain after the initial setup, in other WGs it becomes costly when you start getting people engaged and see the need to maintain that engagement and that usually happens through giving out tasks AND we tend to lose most people during low budget period because there's nothing for them to do.  How do we go about the budget minimum? Making cuts no matter how low it gets as there is no extra money somewhere coming to save you even if it means that fewer people get tasks. On the other hand, we can not exactly tell WGs to cut down to the barest minimum tasks rewards just to keep everyone engaged because that is stepping on WG autonomy and would become disrespectful at some point to people doing great work. Get information from WGs on if their current budget cap does cover their essentials, what essential bits that aren't covered and how much more they need. The aim is to see how we can progress the discussion on tweaking budget caps in the future.  What do we mean by contribution and participation? Just a side convo: If someone attends two meetings at the same time with just their faces there does that count as a contribution? It depends on what we are looking for essentially, we can set the parameters of what participation or contribution are according to what matters to us as a community.",

        "narrative": "LOWER REWARDS PER HOUR / TASK. In our recent conversation, there was a shared concern about how rewards are being handled with the current low token price. Love brought up that it's unclear what the suggestion to adjust rewards is really trying to fix. She pointed out that workgroups are already informally lowering rewards-people are getting paid less without it being openly acknowledged. She felt this wasn't ideal or fair, and questioned the need to formalize something that's already happening quietly. Vani agreed and added that adjusting rewards just to keep up the same pace of work feels misleading. If the token value drops, that should naturally impact how much we can take on. Otherwise, it creates a false impression that nothing's changed. She also mentioned that some groups are setting fixed AGIX amounts per task instead of pegging them to USD, which automatically lowers the payout if the price drops-but that has its own downsides. Love gave a personal example of when she got paid in AGIX after a price crash. Even though she put in hours of work, her payout was far lower than usual-just $23 instead of the usual $80. She said it felt unfair and demotivating, and she had to speak up about it to the workgroup lead. Overall, we felt that the current approach doesn't reflect the true value of contributors' time and effort, especially during downturns, and there's a need for a more transparent and sustainable system.  WORKGROUP COMPENSATION AND QUALITY.  Our discussions focused on whether reducing rewards would address core issues like performance or quality. Guillermo emphasized the need to prioritize work and integrate strategy rather than simply cutting compensation. Peter also highlighted the ongoing tension between fair pay and budget limits, noting the shift from passion-driven to financially-driven work. Vani warned that lower pay often leads to lower quality, particularly in demanding tasks like documentation, and agreed on prioritization over broad cost-cutting. We recognized that while the ambassador program promotes a unique view of compensation, economic realities persist. A key unresolved question remains: Should workgroups have full autonomy over rewards, or should there be standardized limits?   AMBASSADOR PROGRAM BUDGET AND WORKGROUP AUTONOMY.  We had a casual but thoughtful conversation about how much freedom workgroups really have-especially around things like setting pay. Peter kicked things off, wondering aloud if there's actually a clear limit to what a workgroup can decide. He pointed out that while things seem flexible, there's also this unspoken line that no one's quite sure about. Vani agreed and said it kind of feels like anyone can suggest anything, and if no one objects during the consent process, it just goes ahead. There's no strict rulebook, but it's working-more or less. Peter added that who's actually involved in that process makes a big difference too. If everyone in a group agrees, they can push things through pretty easily. We also talked about budget caps being a safety net-so even if someone wanted to pay a lot for something like facilitation, they're still limited by how much they have to spend. Love brought it back to values, questioning whether spending a lot on something like that is really the best use of funds. Vani asked about the background of the Ambassador Programme and why they didn't go with market rates. Peter explained it was mostly because of budget constraints-token prices were low, and they had limited funds to begin with. Wrapping up, We circled back to workgroup autonomy, saying it still feels like the heart of the issue. Vani added that sure, people can do what they want-but that doesn't always mean it's the best approach. There's a sense that some choices, while technically allowed, might still raise questions or push boundaries.  SCALING AND BUDGET MANAGEMENT. Guillermo kicked things off by emphasizing that while scaling is important, it's not a magic solution. Just scaling up or down without a clear strategy can leave us in the same spot. He asked a key question-what are we really trying to achieve with scaling? He pointed out that this also ties into autonomy: for example, if a workgroup wants to pay $100 for facilitation, that decision depends on how autonomous they are. His concern was less about cost-cutting and more about ensuring there's space for open discussion and decision-making within teams. He also reflected on how, even with past budget discussions, we keep circling back to the same core issue-demographics-and the need to adapt our approach based on the context people are working in, including macroeconomic conditions. He noted that while we initially budgeted $0.30, we've managed to survive the past few months on less than $0.20, thanks to suggestions from others. This sparked the idea that the data from this quarter could give us real insight into how to move forward effectively. Peter jumped in to add that most of the easy cost-saving measures have already been implemented-less frequent meetings, cuts in documentation and facilitation, and trimmed-down deliverables. It's not just about doing less; it's about doing smarter. Guillermo wrapped up by pointing out that for his team, the focus has shifted. It's no longer just about building things-it's about whether people are actually using what they build. The tighter budget has forced them to think more critically and process more data before taking action, which could be seen as a positive shift. He suggested it would be useful to gather feedback from all workgroup leads soon to understand the real outcomes of these changes and help guide the next steps.  WORKGROUP MEETING FREQUENCY AND ASYNC MANAGEMENT. Vani raised the idea of evaluating how switching workgroups to monthly meetings as a cost-saving measure has impacted everyone. She feels it's generally worked well, but thinks there needs to be better support for asynchronous (async) work-like clearer systems, better use of tools like Discord, and maybe specific roles to help facilitate it. To understand the full picture, she suggests asking each workgroup to include in their quarterly reports how the change has affected them-what worked, what didn't, and what they've learned. We all agreed with the idea, stating that it's important to get that feedback, especially since we've put effort into setting up structures for async work. Vani points out that the AI Ethics group was one of the first to shift to monthly meetings and remembers initially being skeptical. She was worried that it would make it harder for new members to get involved. Love, who helps support async work in that group, says that while there were concerns at first, new people are still getting involved. They find tasks through meetings or Discord, and she follows up to make sure the work gets done. But she emphasizes that having someone in a support role like hers is key to making async work successful. Peter then asks whether they should bring this idea to the next Workgroup Sync Call or just go ahead and ask for it in the quarterly reports. Vani suggests floating the idea in the sync call first to see how people feel about it. If it gets pushback, they can figure out a different approach. The Workgroup Sync call was then scheduled for Nextweek Monday - 15:00 UTC.    DISCUSSION ON COMMUNITY WEBSITE AND UPCOMING AGENDA ITEMS. Peter brought up the idea of discussing community websites, mentioning an initiative from SingularityNET to create a central entry point for Deep Funding Ambassadors and BGI. This could involve integrating native blog posts, possibly through Substack or WordPress. He suggested this topic be included on the agenda. Guillermo also added that the R&D proposal voting results will be announced today, and they plan to spotlight the winners-either by having them join live or reading short summaries if they can't make it. We all agreed to continue this discussion during the Thursday governance meeting, which will also cover how to give feedback to workgroups when perceived quality is low. Advance chimed in, seeking clarification about the website discussion. Peter explained the goal is to have a unified site that directs people to various parts of the Ambassador Program, BGI efforts, and related developer initiatives-essentially a central hub with shared resources like calendars and event info.",

          "Ideation Upon The Ambassador's Program New Site: Osmium shared that a website for the ambassador program was being designed but progress paused. According to him, from the organization's side, something similar is being built by external developers. He also suggested that we should be able to control our content, posts, and visibility and mentioned holding workshops to plan and share some ideas. Kizzy mentioned his concern he raised during Tuesday's townhall about integrating some of the existing tools and resources like the skills database, knowledge base, and the education guild site",
          "Discussion on AI Sandbox Toolset Exhibition Report: We continued on a discussion regarding the various toolsets we have presented and the ones we could possibly adopt. While there was no conclusion on settling on one, Kizzy mentioned some of the tools like HeyGen AI being used by the education guild while he shared the report for us to bring our suggestions. He emphasized the need for clear use cases to justify adopting new tools like Google LM Notetaker over existing ones like Read AI rather than just creating report. Osmium added the use of Zapier for marketing campaigns and sending emails. Advance gave a broader look of Airtable AI and how it can serve as a centralised work management space that can track activities and as well integrate some 'traditional' tools and even Zapier. He added that it would not be an easy transition, assuming we adopt it. The discussion later continued with Podcastle being suggested as a tool instead of Riverside, which has been adopted by marketing to help with their podcast, as mentioned by Gorga, with settling on how to deal with watermark issues"

        "narrative": "QUALITY STANDARDS  Guillermo reflects on how ambassador program has grown and improved over time, learning from both mistakes and successes. He feels the evolution has been organic, shaped by regular retrospectives and the strengths of the people involved. He sparks a conversation about what 'quality' really means. He wonders how our standards have changed over the past year, how it varies across different teams, and how experience plays a role. It's a tricky topic, and he admits he doesn't have all the answers-he just wants to open it up for honest discussion. Vani responds by saying it's tough to define a single standard because everyone's work is so different. She thinks creating detailed rules might not be realistic, but points out that people usually recognize when something isn't quite up to par. Instead of rigid standards, she suggests we might need a way for people-especially those outside a team-to raise concerns when something doesn't feel right.   WORKGROUP AUTONOMY AND QUALITY  We discussed whether it's appropriate for people outside a workgroup to comment on the quality of that group's work. Peter feels that members within a group are better positioned to address issues, as they're involved in the discussions and can spot problems more easily. However, he notes that people outside the group often hesitate to point out small issues, even though they shouldn't. Vani agrees that minor details may not always be worth raising, but emphasizes the importance of having a way to address more serious concerns about overall quality without causing tension between teams.    QUALITY CONTROL AND EVALUATION PROCESS  We discussed how to evaluate work quality, particularly balancing attention to detail with broader results. Guillermo emphasizes that details matter, especially once a basic quality standard is set, but that we shouldn't judge work solely on small flaws. He suggests a system for improving quality by assigning dedicated reviewers-similar to how editors work in publishing-since creators can't handle everything alone. Vani adds that the level of scrutiny should depend on the context: internal documents can be less polished, but anything outward-facing should meet higher standards, including proofreading. We all agreed on the need for a clear process to address quality and feedback without causing conflict, and Guillermo proposes looking at examples of past work that have been particularly strong to help set those standards moving forward.  DISCUSSION ON DELIVERABLES AND STANDARDS  Guillermo suggests that each workgroup should take a close look at their successes to help set clear standards for things like efficiency and sustainability. This would give everyone a way to measure and improve their efforts. Peter, on the other hand, wonders how we set those standards. He talks about the community website's welcome video, which he initially thought needed an update, but upon watching, realized it was still really well done. He questions how we should compare new work to something that already feels like a high standard. Vani added, pointing out that it's not just about whether something is good, but also about whether anyone is actually seeing it. She highlights the idea that it's possible to create something great, but if it goes unnoticed, its value is limited. Guillermo agrees, adding that we need to think about both the quality and the effectiveness of our work. He wraps up by referring to some shared notes about improvements in the governance process and how members can now provide more input.   IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND QUALITY FEEDBACK MECHANISMS  We discussed how to address concerns about work quality within a team. Guillermo mentions that each workgroup has its own quality standard but questions if these standards are working effectively. He asks whether issues can be raised informally without requiring a detailed quality standard. Vani responds that the current process, especially through consent on budgets, doesn't allow for effective communication of minor quality concerns, leading to confrontational or awkward conversations. She suggests the need for a better way to address these issues outside formal processes. Guillermo agrees, noting that constructive feedback should be encouraged. Vani compares this to discussions in deep funding about the importance of quality and emphasizes the value of reflective practice for teams to assess whether they have met their objectives.   EXPLORING REFLECTIVE PRACTICES AND FEEDBACK MECHANISM  We discussed the idea of incorporating 'critical friends'-trusted outsiders who provide honest, constructive feedback-into our work processes. Vani suggests having periodic check-ins with such individuals. Guillermo humorously notes that these friends are often avoided because of their blunt honesty but agrees with the concept, proposing possibly forming a small team of such reflective peers. Peter adds that it's hard to get unspoken feedback and suggests implementing anonymous feedback mechanisms, like forms or a 'trust person,' to surface concerns safely. We all acknowledged the potential challenges with anonymity but sees value in setting quality standards and fostering open, honest reflection.   QUALITY STANDARDS AND WORKGROUP ENGAGEMENT  We discussed how to define and pursue quality within collaborative workgroups. Guillermo emphasizes using references, templates, and standards-whether from within the group or outside industries-to guide creative and productive processes. He suggests that criticism should be constructive, aiming for improvement rather than just pointing out flaws. The conversation touches on the need for reflection, inclusivity, and efficiency, noting that higher quality often comes with practice and iteration. Vani raises the issue of quarterly reports lacking depth, often being superficial or self-congratulatory, and suggests adding reflective sections. However, there's uncertainty about who should define what constitutes 'quality.' Peter argues that workgroups typically self-regulate quality and that external imposition could feel intrusive, although he agrees it's fine to point out clearly low-quality outcomes. We overall seems to agree that quality should be functional and impactful rather than merely polished or award-winning, and that shared standards, reflection, and involvement are key to improving quality over time.    KPIs AND ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES  We discussed how to improve and measure the quality of content-particularly videos-within the organizational setting. Guillermo emphasizes focusing on clear, measurable KPIs and investing more deeply in fewer, higher-impact efforts (e.g., 2-3 videos with strong engagement vs. 10 with none). He suggests that quality should be defined by purpose and audience engagement, not just volume or aesthetics. There's a broader debate about decoupling quality discussions from budget decisions, as raised by Vani, to encourage honest feedback without fear of funding cuts. Guillermo and Peter acknowledge that while it's ideal to have open, constructive criticism, current dynamics often make that difficult. Maximilez proposes a more systematic solution: monthly content reviews and ratings for each workgroup, which could foster accountability and improvement through indirect critique and positive competition. Overall, we all seems to agree that clearer objectives, audience awareness, and mature communication are necessary for sustainable growth and quality improvement.   DISCUSSION ON IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES  We discussed how to move forward with the 'honest friends' approach and other related ideas. While there's recognition that many of these concepts have been addressed in workgroups and guilds already, the main concern is how to include all program members in the process and turn these discussions into concrete actions. There's agreement on the need to summarize the meeting, list potential actions, and plan implementation. We proposed creating a simple document or spreadsheet before the next meetings (Monday - Workgroup Sync call and Tuesday - Governance Call). Peter also suggests adding a reflection section in the quarterly report and notes that some initiatives, like the honest friends idea, may require time or budgeting. We all agreed to begin with low-cost, simple solutions and continue the discussion next week Monday (Async call slated for 15:00 UTC).",

        "narrative": "BUDGET REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF WORKGROUP NEEDS  Vani shared the updated budget, which includes everyone's original input plus a new column for each team's 'bare minimum' funding needs. Teams were grouped into three categories: no response (assumed okay) - Education guild, Strategy guild, Gamers guild and Education WG, satisfied with their cap, and those asking for more. We're currently $3,300 over budget. To address this, Vani suggested reviewing the teams asking for more to see if their 'minimum' needs are truly essential. Tevo questioned what we mean by 'need,' suggesting some teams could scale back or reuse content to save money (suspend operations for a quarter or not do anything new). Vani pushed back, warning that too many cutbacks could weaken the ambassador program, as we've seen before. Tevo clarified he wasn't suggesting a full stop, just smarter use of existing content. Others raised concerns about losing momentum if teams like video or writing pause their work. We discussed whether the video team's tasks like content creation and social media are areas to trim. Peter stressed not singling out any team but agreed we should assess where time and money are really going. We all agreed to go back to the different Workgroups and ask them to review their funding requests carefully and look for fair, practical cuts that won't hurt the program's impact or team morale.  VIDEO WORKGROUP BUDGET REQUEST: EVALUATION OVERVIEW  The video team is operating with a tight budget, focusing only on short-form content (like Town Hall shorts) due to lack of funds. They've cut rewards, reduced editing rates, and still have unpaid work from last quarter, affecting this quarter's budget. There's growing concern about whether some recurring tasks like shorts and Zealy engagement efforts are worth continuing. Some suggest prioritizing more creative content or cutting non-essential work. Vani urged all teams to reassess their budgets and identify what's truly essential. Treasury guild might need extra support since it handles critical payments. As time ran out, we discussed how to move forward: finalize minimum budgets first, then redistribute any extra. Some workgroups, like Archives, are already running with barebones setups but that may not be sustainable long term. Tough choices lie ahead.  BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION / PRIORITIES  FOR WORKGROUP  Tevo proposed a tiered budget approach: give each group $1,000 upfront to see what they can do, then offer more in a second round based on performance. Vani was skeptical, saying it would take too much time and coordination, especially with Q3 budgets due soon. Peter noted that overhead costs seem stable now. Vani clarified that this isn't about blaming anyone, but hard choices may be needed - like prioritizing content vs. governance. Some groups have asked for only small increases; others much more, raising the question of how to fairly redistribute funds.We talked on the deeper issue: what does the Ambassador Program actually value most? Governance, record-keeping, and decentralization were highlighted as core to its identity, not just optional extras. Ideas like quantifying internal vs. external impact or running a survey to gauge group importance were floated, and it was done. Vani stressed the need for groups requesting more to clearly define their true minimum needs. Lordkizzy asked if reserves could help. A lot of people  gave a clear 'no' using reserves for recurring costs was already rejected in previous decisions. The goal is to make tough but sustainable budget calls now. We agreed that some groups may need to cut or rethink operations, and Tevo made a point that those who need less budget shouldn't be penalized. The focus moving forward is clarity, fairness, and smarter prioritization.  BUDGET MANAGEMENT AND WORKGROUP SUPPORT  Tevo shared his frustration from last year's budget cuts and proposed a new approach: allocate funds based on the collective sentiment of contributors, rather than strict numbers. Groups could choose to keep the funds, return some to reserves, or share with others. The idea was to make the budget allocation a collaborative, priority-driven process. Vani appreciated the idea but raised concerns about people judging workgroups they're not directly involved in, leading to biased or vague impressions. Tevo suggested this would be iterative, with future evaluations based on impact, creating a learning loop. Peter warned that underfunding could lead to groups collapsing, which could have a negative emotional and community impact. Maxmilez suggested a compromise: keep current caps but allow some extra funding if needed, possibly using unused reserves from other groups. Vani acknowledged this but raised the question of whether some groups, like Treasury, could function on just the caps. We wrapped up the meeting with a few options for next steps: meet again on Thursday, adopt Maxmilez's proposal, ask groups what they could do with their caps, or explore Tevo's sentiment-based model.  PLANNING, PRIORITIZATION & FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS We raised concerns about timing, noting that while gathering input is useful, it won't solve the deeper, systemic issues this quarter. We also called for the need to have a broader conversation on work quality, priorities, and long-term sustainability. As an interim step, we suggested setting basic budget caps for now and continuing the discussion on the next Governance Call happening on Thursday. Tevo agreed on collecting some quick input - even a simple graph or 10-minute survey could offer insights. Vani supported the idea but cautioned against relying on too small a sample. Peter emphasized the value of learning from mistakes, as long as outcomes are tracked and improvements follow. He suggested saving deeper governance talks for Thursday and Tevo volunteered to create a ranked choice voting tool or forum to help structure that discussion. It might be a bit much, he admitted, but it could help guide Thursday's session. The meeting wrapped up with Peter encouraging contributions to the upcoming Town Hall, especially from those with non-governance topics, and confirmed that our conversation would continue in the next Open Governance call happening next week Thursday.",

          "AI Event Update: CJfrankie gave a breakdown on the AI event that took place at Los Angeles, discussing the benefits and challenges of AI, particularly in security applications. He highlighted the high costs associated with AI technology and emphasized the need to view AI as a supportive tool rather than a job threat. CJfrankie also mentioned networking opportunities, although he did not have a chance to onboard new members to SingularityNet due to lack of time.",
          "Updates on Project Collaborations and Guild Activities: Malik reported no new updates or collaborations from the guilds he oversees, such as the education and gamers guilds. A lot of that is being handled by the core members already.",
          "A.O.B: Advanceameyaw provided marketing updates, including brand guidelines and collaboration plans with the African Guild. He mentioned an upcoming Ubuntu and AI conference and ongoing discussions about AI ethics and community awareness initiatives. LordKizzy addressed the shift in the graphics team's focus and ongoing budget management processes. Mikasa updated the group on her return to work and confirmed that the social media spotlight would be scheduled to go out after this call. Photogee provided updates on the podcast, and the usual weekly posts were shared. Singularity Scavenger Hunt: Eric Davies introduced the Singularity Scavenger Hunt, which aims to enhance user engagement with the SingularityNet platform through gamified challenges. Participants will solve cryptograms, complete AI-related tasks, and answer trivia questions to familiarize themselves with the ecosystem. The initiative is expected to boost user onboarding and retention while spreading awareness of SingularityNet's offerings. Allocation and Operations Discussion: Lordkizzy addressed the allocation tool and the delay in Zealy sprints, seeking clarity on operations and the need for prioritization. Photogee discussed the operational aspects of initiatives, while Eric Davies elaborated on the stress associated with moderation and content management tasks. The conversation underscored the importance of documenting time spent on tasks for proper allocation. Kateri updated the group that she had submitted the use spotlights and would work on the committee spotlight this week. Photogee inquired about role responsibilities and treasury updates, prompting Lordkizzy to explain the feedback process for incomplete tasks and the transparency of budget information. Lordkizzy emphasized that market fluctuations affect budget allocations, and that the current financial status is available on the charity.org website."

          "Onboarders Team Updates: Love shared her updates on her recent onboarding experience and so invited the Onboarders team to share updates on their recent onboarding experiences. Vani and Lordkizzy both noted a decline in new member joining, prompting the group to shift focus toward mentoring and supporting current members. CJfrankie shared his progress promoting the ambasssador program at the Crypto Evangelist Telegram group and mentioned an upcoming call to discuss the SingularityNET Ambassador Program. Gorga shared a positive mentoring experience, where he helped a new member get started with asset creation tasks.",
          "New members engagement: We had a blast discussion about the current challenges facing new members e.i New people are not really going elsewhere than the usual favourite WGs (Writers, Video). Lordkizzy said many are interested in content creation, which doesn't always match open workgroups. Vani wondered if is it that they don't have the right skillset for e.g. Treasury, Education, etc - or that they are not interested in those groups - or is it just that they don't think they have the right skills? and we need to explain it better how they can fit in?   Onboarding Challenges and Opportunities: Gorga emphasized that joining the Gamers Guild requires specific conditions, such as consistent meeting attendance and skill in creating assets. Lordkizzy noted that the major factors for guilds/workgroup is AGIX price fluctuations, which reduces the number of task a workgroup or guild can create for their members.  Lordkizzy emphasized that understanding the structure takes time and so he keeps encouraging the new members to be consistent in attending the meeting and they will with time get to understand how the system works  Love raised another challenge that new members might face in communication, difficulties understanding various accents during meetings. Love pointed out that it is difficult to understand languages that you are not used to. Lordkizzy encouraged members to ask questions without hesitation and reassured the group that regular participation helps build familiarity and understanding over time.",
          "Improving Clarity and Communication in Meeting: Love raised a challenge that new members might face in communication, due to various accents during meetings. Furthermore, pointed out that it is difficult to understand languages that you are not used to. Lordkizzy encouraged members to ask questions without hesitation and reassured the group that regular participation helps build familiarity and understanding over time. Vani suggested that written agenda helps attendees understand the meeting more clearly. She acknowledged that while the GitHub board is useful, returning to written agendas in some workgroups might improve clarity and engagement.  Building on this idea of improving communications, the Read A.i transcription features was suggested to help them better understand what's being said.",
          "Connectivity challenges: Vani shared her experience with poor internet and how it helped her understand what others deal with regularly. Getting kicked out repeatedly was frustrating, and she pointed out that people with stable connections might not fully understand how difficult it can be. Vani suggested raising more awareness about connection issues. While we can't fix them, we can support each other for example, by posting quick updates in the chat when someone drops off. Love added that when she rejoins after a disconnection, she usually asks what's going on, and people are always quick to catch her up.",

The quorum for the marketing guild was established, requiring five core members and three task force members, with agreement that eight core members alone would suffice. CJFrankie was asked to copy the document, resolve the comments, and share it with the group for final acceptance next week.",

CjFrankie confirmed that the Writers WG has a collaborative budget for the Zealy initiative, while Kenichi clarified that the budget would be $200, which is an increase from the initially budgeted $150. Ayo facilitated the discussion, ensuring clarity on the budget and collaboration among the involved workgroups.",
          "Proposal Review and Role Clarification: Ayo highlighted a concern raised by LordKizzy about Eric Davies' proposal, noting that it includes charges for services the guild already funds. Ayo suggested that clarity is needed regarding the roles of project managers and other positions within the guild, urging that names of current members responsible for social media and content creation be included in the documentation.",
          "Task Management and Review Process: Ayo highlighted the need for clarity on task priorities and collaboration within the team. Kareem expressed dissatisfaction with the current task submission timeline and proposed that two individuals should handle task reviews to prevent delays and ensure fairness. Lordkizzy clarified that there are already two reviewers in place and explained the payment process, which has shifted to a weekly schedule. Kareem expressed frustration over repeated delays in task creation, advocating for a structured approach to prevent one person's delay from impacting the entire guild. Ayo supported this view, highlighting the importance of setting a deadline for task submissions to ensure timely reviews and payments. Kenichi suggested that tasks should be logged from the beginning of the month to facilitate updates and reviews.",
          "Decision on Timeline for Monthly Tasks: Ayo led a discussion on the appropriate number of days to allocate for task completion at the beginning of the month, with options ranging from three to seven days.

Kareem raised concerns about the implications of this deadline and suggested that if tasks are not completed, there should be someone available to take over.",
          "Challenges in Event Participation and Marketing Strategies: CjFrankie expressed difficulties in locating AI-related events and obtaining speaking slots, highlighting that many organizers are now charging for participation. Kenichi added that the current token price is a barrier and referenced a Twitter space playbook that could help improve engagement."

          "Updates and Introductions: The meeting began with Peter and Gorga acknowledging the absence of the host, Ayo, and the lack of a formal agenda. A suggestion was made for Martinsoki to share the previous week's summary notes to guide the discussion. The group also addressed the need for clarity on governance documents and the upcoming Zealy initiative, which is set to kick off on May 12th.",
          "Task Creation and Review Process Concerns: Kareem raised concerns about the inefficiencies in the task creation and review process, particularly criticizing Ese and LordKizzy for not reaching out for clarifications despite having ample time for reviews. He also pointed out the lack of oversight on deliverables and questioned why team members are not held accountable for their responsibilities. Additionally, he mentioned difficulties in getting responses regarding the graphic design workgroup's budget management. Lordkizzy explained the timeline for task reviews in the Marketing Guild, stating that there are two reviews each month and that tasks must meet KPIs for payment. He highlighted the importance of having two reviewers for tasks to ensure thorough oversight. Additionally, he addressed concerns regarding the design workgroup's submissions, indicating that tasks must be reviewed to avoid budget criticisms. Kareem addressed concerns about his contributions to the design workgroup, asserting that his designs are documented and serve as templates for ongoing projects. He highlighted that his work is visible to the group, which negates the need for an extra reviewer. Ese addressed the allegations concerning task management and payment schedules. The efforts made to communicate tax updates to the team were explained, and the adjusted payment processes-revised in response to previous deficits-were reiterated. Kareem emphasized the importance of proper documentation and clear communication to prevent misunderstandings. Kareem raised issues about the review of design tasks, suggesting that there should always be someone available to oversee the work, especially when team members are unavailable. He criticized the practice of submitting tasks for payment without proper review and called for clearer guidelines on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for graphics. The need for established KPIs to improve accountability and clarity within the team was supported by Photogee. Photogee clarified his stance on task reviews, stating that he believes only one person should handle the review process to prevent complications. Kareem stressed the importance of reaching a consensus on the way forward, Ese mentioned that certain tasks could not be processed for payment due to pending submissions from other team members. The discussion highlighted ongoing confusion regarding task verification and payment. LordKizzy questioned the necessity of waiting for all submissions before conducting reviews, emphasizing that reviews are typically scheduled at the end of each month. They also expressed confusion over a governance decision made without full consensus, particularly regarding quorum and objections. Kareem proposed adding a third reviewer to streamline the process, which was generally supported by other participants.",
          "Budget Management and Decision-Making Processes: Kenichi called for LordKizzy to deliver a comprehensive report on the budget, detailing monthly spending and its allocation. He stressed that this information is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of their financial decisions. LordKizzy reinforced the transparency of their financial records and pointed out the necessity of resolving objections before reaching decisions, indicating that discussions are ongoing. Kenichi highlighted the necessity for the Marketing Guild to focus on delivering metrics that correlate with budget spending, urging LordKizzy to present data on their contributions. He expressed that sharing weekly updates would foster clarity and accountability among members. Kenichi also criticized the tendency to revisit previously discussed topics, advocating for a more structured approach to meetings. LordKizzy clarified that the Marketing Guild is not deepfunding and that quarterly reports are created to assess budget allocation. Kenichi expressed frustration over the lack of detailed metrics and accountability from team members, suggesting that more frequent updates could improve transparency and performance evaluation. The idea of monthly audits to enhance the reporting process was supported by a conference room participant. LordKizzy questioned Kenichi about his reporting practices and the accessibility of Zealy metrics, highlighting delays in communication. Kenichi defended his reporting efforts, stating he shares metrics at the beginning of each month and that the Zealy data requires individual task checks. The discussion revealed ongoing frustrations regarding communication and accountability within the guild.",
          "Kareem Thomas suggested to have additional calls as needed to address ongoing issues without waiting for the next scheduled meeting."

        "narrative": "We started by going through tasks 'in progress' on Github; - We gave a quick nudge to people still on meeting documentation tasks from last quarter. We might have to record the 3rd February meeting notes as 'no summary' if it's not there on the summary tool(Vani will check this out).   - Learnings from Q3 & Q4 Interviews: Vani will use insights from this session to improve our training materials and get it ready by our next meeting in June.  - WG Sync Calls: We will raise a discussion on payments in advance for tasks yet to be done at the call today.  - Transcription tasks: We have asked that people assigned get started on their respective interviews transcription if they haven't done so now that the token price is looking good, and give updates on their GitHub issues. One thing we have learned here is that we should have asked people to have them done even when the token price was down so that they could get paid whenever token price looks good because now we are going to have make use of that faith we did not have and hope that the token price doesn't crash down while people are getting transcriptions done. In the long run, we should try normalizing anonymised interviews to ease our workflow when we transcribe them from the recordings.  - Q2 2025 Budget update: Price is up, and anything that has to do with research and data collection is our priority; what do we do? Aside from paying for Q1 transcription tasks(all 15 of them), should we revert to our original budget for admin roles? And should we pay for any of the admin tasks now? Colleen suggested that we revert to the original budget of 0.30 for admin roles in addition to extra interviews; Vani pointed out that we are slightly over the budget overall and that if we pay out most things as it is now, then we won't have anything extra if the token gets back quite high.  Love was of the opinion that we do not top up the admin roles and instead use this chance to clear up at least half of the carried-over payment(specifically the co-chair role) from last quarter that is just sitting there before doing more interviews if possible and the rest of it. Vani agreed that keeping things for too long in the background is bad practice but that she would prefer we use that money we want to subsidize for the co-chair role payment from last quarter for more interviews instead. She also said that everything depends on token price in the next few weeks and our priority is still getting transcription tasks paid and the editing/checking of course and that once we are done paying for the ones on the board currently then we can think about what to do about the carried-over payment. She also suggested that the admins go back and discuss more on this and come up with a final solution. Peter pointed out that we should keep in mind that the co-chair role payment we are talking about was budgeted in Q1 2025 with a token price of 0.50. It is still an issue.  - More Interviews: We asked people who are up for possible interviews depending on token price and budget to signify and we got a good number including people who didn't do interviews last time. We had PG, Grandi, Clement, Maximilez...etc. We are trying to get prepared.  - AOB Colleen announced an event(community discussion) coming up next week(19th May at 14:00 UTC) where she will be representing us at, and invited us all to attend. The topic is AI Ethics and the ethics of achieving AI emotions and giving ASI emotions.",

        "narrative": "BUDGET RETHINK DECISION   We discussed rethinking the budget cap, with Vani sharing a draft spreadsheet to capture each workgroup's bare minimum needs-just a starting point, not final figures. She emphasized the challenge of defining what's truly essential and warned against over-reporting. The goal is to understand who needs more and why, while being fair to all. We all agreed and suggested that we ask teams to show how their current cap compares to their minimum needs. To deal with token price swings, we proposed using a fixed AGI reference price or listing needs in USD for clarity. Vani will adjust the spreadsheet and is welcoming feedback.   BUDGET ALLOCATION AND PRIORITIZATION DISCUSSION  Guillermo shared that LATAM teams have been making do without asking for more, though they could really use twice as much. He questioned whether extra funding should come with clear expectations or outcomes. Vani agreed there's need for limits, noting that more money for one team might mean less for another. She suggested adding a column in the budget spreadsheet to indicate where extra funds should come from-though she admitted that could cause tension. She also referenced Peter's point that in the chats that being resourceful shouldn't be penalized. Ultimately, she said the group needs to figure out how to evaluate which requests are truly necessary, even if the process is uncomfortable.   BUDGET REDUCTIONS AND WORKGROUP ALLOCATION   Peter shared some tough news: due to the Phase Two token model, overall funding is dropping-about 1.241 million tokens for the year, which could mean up to a 30% cut from last quarter. Vani suggested two ways to handle it: either a flat cut for all teams or a proportional one that protects lower-funded groups. She leaned toward the flat cut for simplicity, allowing teams to request more if needed. Peter mentioned using reserves to soften the impact, but the group pushed back-reserves should be for special cases, not to cover regular gaps. Guillermo agreed, supporting a balanced, fair approach. In the end, we agreed to apply an equal percentage cut to all budget caps in the spreadsheet, with room for teams to adjust or ask for more if necessary.   BUDGET ALLOCATION DISCUSSION    Vani suggested a shift in how the group approaches budgeting. Instead of focusing strictly on financial totals-like how much each group needs or has-it might be more useful to look at the activities each team is planning and what their 'bare minimum' requirements are. She emphasized the need for group input and consensus, rather than making top-down decisions. She then asked if we should distribute the budget loss evenly across all workgroups, percentage-wise? She proposed that this even distribution would serve as the budget cap for the next quarter. Guillermo reminded everyone that the next quarter starts in about two weeks, so decisions need to happen quickly. Vani volunteered to put the spreadsheet plan out by the end of the day and asked whether people could respond quickly.   FUNDING AND UPCOMING MEETINGS  We discussed cleaning up the budget spreadsheet-Vani suggested simplifying totals and rounding numbers for clarity. The meeting felt a bit stuck since progress depends on input from other teams. We used the time to plan for Thursday's big discussion, agreeing it needs structure to avoid turning into a chaotic defense of individual projects. We'll raise awareness through the town hall and channel reminders, even if it feels repetitive. There was tension around recent token cuts-Vani voiced concern, especially for the ambassador program, while Peter explained it was a broader, community-backed decision to stretch resources. Looking ahead, we agreed Thursday's meeting won't be useful without full team input. Vani offered to follow up and suggested adding a column to the spreadsheet to ask if more cuts are possible. Peter noted some teams, like Knowledge Base, aren't requesting more, which may help balance things. We plan to tweak and share the spreadsheet by day's end and bring it to the town hall. Vani's unsure how Thursday will go-but expects strong turnout: 'people always show up when it's about money.' Maxmilez kindly offered to handle the meeting summary of our next (Open GovWG) meeting happening this Thursday - 15th May.",

He encouraged members to contribute agenda items and highlighted the need for clarity regarding the task creation and review process, as raised by Kareem. LordKizzy requested the addition of a marketing guild budget discussion to the agenda, emphasizing the urgency for feedback before an upcoming deadline.",
          "Budget Reductions and Marketing Strategy Adjustments: LordKizzy outlined the financial challenges facing the marketing program, noting a reduction in budget from 10,000 AGX to 7,171 AGX for Q2. He emphasized the need for drastic cuts and suggested restructuring the team due to inactive roles. Kareem proposed rewarding participants in AGIX tokens instead of USD to better align incentives with the program's goals. LordKizzy raised concerns about the impact of AGIX price fluctuations on budgeting for marketing initiatives. He detailed calculations showing that the current budget allocations for core and taskforce members may not be sufficient to support operational needs. Kareem added that the team should reconsider the long-term value attached to these budgets and questioned the number of subscriptions currently in place. Kareem proposed again that rewards for contributors should be given in AGIX, regardless of its price, and highlighted the necessity of restructuring roles to align compensation with individual output. Ayo questioned the implications of ongoing budget cuts for workgroups without campaigns, suggesting that adjustments should originate from governance rather than individual workgroups. LordKizzy provided context on the budget reductions, explaining they stem from a long-term agreement affecting the program's funding. The proposed budget restructuring focused on marketing campaigns was questioned, with a request for clarity on how it would affect guild members' roles and operational tasks. Kareem suggested that all roles should be aligned with marketing goals, while LordKizzy pointed out the necessity of maintaining operational functions, such as project management and documentation. The conversation underscored the challenge of allocating funds effectively while ensuring that essential activities are not neglected.  Kenichi highlighted the need to consider the impact on other work groups and suggested that payments should be structured in AGIX tokens to avoid complications with USD values. LordKizzy also expressed concerns about whether AGIX adequately compensates for time spent on tasks."

        "narrative": "During the meeting we discussed several important topics: establishing a quorum for decision-making, handling anonymity and abstentions, possible changes to the budget cap form, updates to the context-setting document, and determining who would be responsible for publicizing these changes. A key concern arose around quorum, sparked by observations that in some workgroups, only three or four members out of about sixty completed consent forms. This raised questions about whether such low participation truly represented the group's collective opinion. The discussion focused on whether setting a quorum-a minimum number of participants needed to validate decisions-could ensure that budget approvals reflect active support rather than silent agreement or disengagement.  Participation threshold based on the number of people who complete a consent form, or quorum based on the number eligible to do so (i.e., total number of core contributors)? We all agreed that quorum should be determined based on the total number of core contributors who are eligible to participate, rather than only counting those who have completed a consent form or are actively engaging at any given moment. This approach was seen as more legitimate because it ensures that decisions represent a meaningful portion of the entire community, not just a subset of currently active members.  Flat number, or percentage? After much debate, we decided that quorum should be expressed as a percentage rather than a flat number. Using a percentage allows the quorum threshold to adjust fairly with the size of the group, accommodating both small and large workgroups. This flexibility was seen as necessary because different groups vary in size and levels of engagement, and a fixed number could either be too high for some groups or too low for others. However, it was also noted that deciding the precise percentage would be a challenge, and might require ongoing review as participation levels shift over time. There was also discussion around distinguishing between general core contributors and active decision-makers, suggesting that quorum might need different thresholds depending on who qualifies as a voting member.  What percentage? The conversation about the exact percentage needed for quorum reached a final agreement during the meeting. The figure of roughly 25% was floated as a potential starting point based on current participation data, but during the course of the meeting we decided to go with 17% as this final quorum percentage. Voting records indicated that about 30% of active members typically participate, but relying on participation alone was seen as risky since abstentions could be used to manipulate outcomes. Therefore, setting quorum as a percentage of all eligible voters rather than just those present or active was favored to ensure decisions have strong community support.  Other discussion points and next steps  The topic of optional anonymity for participants was briefly raised but not fully discussed. There was also no clear resolution on how abstentions should be treated in the quorum count or decision-making process. Tevo expressed his concern about the general low engagement in some workgroups, with some citing data from the Treasury guild showing minimal participation. To address this, we suggested raising awareness and encourage more members to get involved. The meeting closed on a positive and lighthearted note, while we all expressed optimism about improving participation and refining the governance process.",

          "Budget Discussion and Marketing Budget Adjustments: LordKizzy highlighted the challenges in determining the budget for different workgroups, noting a significant reduction in funding allocations. The discussion included the need for a structured approach to future initiatives, with a total budget of $2,400 currently outlined. Concerns were raised about the sustainability of rewards for core members if token prices continue to reduce. Photogee expressed dissatisfaction with the ongoing reduction of rewards and proposed weekly meetings to brainstorm solutions. Ese suggested a compensation model based on task completion to ensure fair pay, while it was highlighted by Ayo that finding a sustainable response to budget constraints is important. A proposal was also made by Ayo to form a committee to explore options for addressing these concerns. A discussion was led on forming a committee to address budget cuts, with members including LordKizzy, Advance, Ese, Gorga, and Kateri volunteering to participate. LordKizzy suggested meeting later that day, which was confirmed by the group. The committee is expected to prepare recommendations for the next call to discuss the impact of budget cuts and strategize solutions.",

          "Discussion on GitHub Updates and Marketing Guild Q1 Review: The efforts of the team were acknowledged, and sharing recommendations with the committee was encouraged. Ese Williams proposed weekly updates on GitHub to improve accountability and ensure timely submissions, while photogee argued that discussions should not be overly focused on the budget, suggesting that other priorities should be addressed as well. It was agreed to include this topic in the agenda for future meetings. Ese Williams summarized the marketing guild's Q1 activities, noting the participation of contributors and the need for more engagement from others. Key initiatives included spotlighting projects and enhancing social media strategies with trend-driven content. It was emphasized by a conference room participant that sharing the summary for further comments is important, and it was mentioned that a scavenger hunt proposal would be added to the agenda for the next meeting."

        "narrative": "- The EOY report for last year(2024) is ready! Waiting for Writers WG to do the rest(get it published or something).  - How do we address work quality in the ambassador program? We've noticed that it can be quite hard to give feedback and receive them if you are not involved with the WG/Guild. Should we try having 1-2 honest friends give genuine feedback moments once or twice a quarter in a WG ? Anonymous form? Trusted person- a confidante who's anonymous too; ad-hoc one on one basis. Reflection in a section of the report? Decouple quality feedback from budgets?  Vani noted that in a way the anonymous form and the trusted person go hand in hand because just sending a form for people to fill out won't get much action whereas the trusted person can champion the whole thing by jumping on a call or something to bring up feedbacks they got anonymously and kind of encourage something to happen. In a sense, we do want some actions to follow most feedback we receive. Guillermo believes that taking up this initiative is a good idea, and the result will be an action item.  - How do we pick the trusted person? Doesn't need to be one person though, could be 2? Vani was of the opinion that the trusted person or honest friend(if that's what we're going for) should be a different person for each WG because that kind of relationship only works if the person(s) really gets what you are doing. If they don't really understand your field of work, then they are not going to be very useful as a trusted friend. Peter added that the honest friends do indeed need to come from different WGs(one per WG) and they would be more proactive but that the trusted person will be for one who will act as a confidante(ad-hoc) or a conduit(in Vani's words). Guillermo suggested we think of how to play the strategy in advance with a calendar, roadmap or timeline, so it doesn't go on for too long; like 2 weeks or so? and then gather up data, output them, maybe bring in an outsider from another WG/Guild to get a read of what is going on and how we do it better. Vani suggested that we set up the anonymous form to ask for people to step up as nominees for the trusted person role, and find a way to choose somebody to do the job for the quarter by handling any criticisms and issues coming through the form. We should also try and ask WGs to give a bit of reflection in their reports and raise whatever issues they think are issues for them. She added that this would be a first step towards the honest friend's approach as it would not be done right away, so WGs don't end up with a random friend who came in from nowhere to criticize their work. It has got to come from them.  Guillermo suggested incorporating an AI agent into the whole critical friend role since it is brutally honest and that we should start trusting these tools to be part of the engagement and to make rational decisions. Vani pointed out that an AI agent won't understand the context of the initiative, as they have never been to a WG meeting and have no idea what the WG is doing and it defeats the point of having a critical friend. She added that the whole critical friend comes from building a relationship before you start criticising so it's a place where you can raise things you are uncertain about, so it is more discursive rather than a kind of rigid rationale. We noted that it is a good idea to at least ask WGs first if they would be in this, just in case some WGs decline taking part in the initiative.  - How are we going to fund this initiative? It is a lot of work. The honest friends will be a scheduled thing so it needs budgeting.  - Do we ask WGs to comment on how fewer meetings have affected them in their reports? Nobody objected to this so I guess it is an agreement.  - Is the payment of tasks in advance a good idea or a bad one?(AI Ethics have been discussing it) The rationale behind this is the fact that token price dropped way below normal so we were kind of afraid that we would not be able to pay for things and it is being brought up because not everyone is exactly aware that they can do this since some WGs are doing it already. Peter pointed out that with the token price we can never know, seeing as paying for tasks in advance could come with a potential downside if the price goes up(I.e, overpaying for tasks), but then it might be favorable over the alternative of not having enough budget to do all your tasks.  Love noted that the only way we can go unscathed in this case is if the token price gets to the point where it is double the price it was when the budget proposal one submitted was approved or something. She also added there is an issue of trust at least with her when it comes to paying people for tasks in advance, and the issue of getting pressured to do a task just because she has been paid for it already.  Effiom suggested that WGs could also try this method of payment with task types which they know that the chances of completing them are pretty high and have low risk involved. Vani pointed out that it is not just about trustworthiness, but more of the task types; for example paying for AI Ethics admin roles and tasks somewhere within the quarter knowing fully well that they have been working and will continue working till the end of the quarter. Should we put a limit on this? We think it would be better if we leave people to work it out for themselves with a little guidance if they want.  We could also ask WGs to reflect this on their report if they are doing it. AdvancedAmeyaw suggested paying in advance to a WG wallet(stable coin based) so that people involved in different tasks can get their agreed fixed reward amount without worries when they are done because not everyone is good at delivering what they were assigned to do on time especially if they are being paid in advance. Peter added that he wouldn't be against WG wallets if not for the fact we do need to make sure that all the transactions keep capturing the metadata of whatever the rewards are for. Peter expressed that AGIX is a utility token which can be given out as rewards for contributions only but that the moment we try to change it to stable coin for payments, it would have legal implications we do not want seeing as we are currently under SingularityNET foundation and not a separate legal entity unless anyone is up to take up that legal risk of course",

        "narrative": "Intro: The call opened with Ayo asking UknowZork how she's been coping, especially since many of the guild meetings have now shifted to a Bi-weekly schedule. He also asked if she's been getting or taking up tasks. UknowZork shared that she's been able to pick up small documentation tasks and is hopeful for more opportunities. Ayo encouraged her, noting that consistent participation and attending calls is the best approach. He asked if UknowZork attends AI Sandbox calls, as they're a great space for learning and growth. Ayo mentioned that the meeting would proceed as planned, though it might be shorter due to fewer attendees. He asked everyone to wait a couple of minutes while he prepared the updates. There was a light moment when Ayo joked about mixing up who's based where, sharing how he recently visited Uyo and Calabar but wasn't sure who from the team lived there. Finally, Ayo said he would share the agenda on screen and suggested using the last meeting's agenda summary as a base since no new notes had been posted yet.  Q2 Updates / Workshop / approach / Research & May TownHall Presentation Ayo shared details about the survey form and shared that since there's not much feedback, the team had decided to change their strategy. Instead of trying to get input during the guild meetings or workshops, like they had originally planned, they're now shifting to a more direct approach. The plan is to reach out to people individually with specific questions, gather their responses, analyze the data, and then send back the results. He explained that the challenge right now is figuring out exactly who to contact in each guild. For example, in the African Guild, they need to identify three reliable members-people who still show up consistently for calls, even with the token price drop. This way, they can be sure they'll get the responses they need.  Ayo also gave an update on the Q2 research, noting that it's a continuation of the Q1 work. The Guild is partnering with Deep Funding and have already compiled a list of documents that he had previously shared with Deep Funding. The main challenge has been figuring out which guild circles to focus on. At first, it seemed like the research was for the IT circle, then it looked like the Review circle, then Data Analytics, and finally Operations. Since Ayo wasn't able to attend the April meeting, he mentioned it might be a good idea to attend the May one for more clarity. He also pointed out that for the Q3 budget, it's already known that the token price has dropped, and there will be cuts to the budget for each workgroup or guild. For instance, Strategy Guild is now set to receive $861, which is adjusted to 2,868 AGIX tokens at the current rate of $0.3 per AGIX. So, the budgets are definitely tighter. He expressed some uncertainty about the research project-whether it's happening at all. With the end of May approaching and only a few weeks left in the quarter, time is running out. Clement added his thoughts, saying that this was the original vision-getting people who are active in the whole AI market space so they could collect more expansive data for fresh perspectives on the analysis. He also took a moment to appreciate the effort of the research team.  AOB: Jeffery asked about  the next steps for the research, reminding Ayo that he had mentioned including him as part of the research team, but he hadn't heard anything since. Ayo apologized for the communication gap, admitting he hadn't been very active on Discord lately and hadn't seen any clear details about including him as part of the research team. After reviewing past conversations, he didn't find much concrete information and suggested there might have been a misunderstanding or missing context. In a lighthearted moment, Ayo even joked that if he had said Jeffery was on the research team, he must have been 'really drunk,' as Jeffery isn't a core member of the Guild.  To smooth things over, Ayo reassured him that he would double-check the meeting details and do a follow up with him. Kateri also mentioned she had some pending messages that hadn't been addressed yet. Ayo apologized again and promised to get back to her after the call.  The meeting wrapped up with Ayo encouraging both Kateri and Jeffery to reach out so they could clarify things and move forward together.",

        "status": "carry over",
        "narrative": "We had an in-depth conversation about how abstentions are handled in votes, the true purpose of the consent process, and some of the challenges we've been facing with engagement and budgeting. Peter pointed out that we can't fully tackle the root issues unless we understand why someone abstains. Often, it's not because they disagree but simply because they don't have the time to review. He suggested we rethink what abstaining means-maybe we ask folks to object only when they see potential harm, and if they don't have the time to review, they just abstain without needing to explain much. Vani and Kevin explored the idea of limiting abstentions-maybe allowing it only in certain cases, like for specific workgroups or a short time window. Kevin, who isn't a regular at every meeting, said he abstains when he doesn't fully understand a proposal and would find it helpful if we had clear, simple summaries before votes. Tuso added that abstaining can sometimes act as a 'soft no,' a way for people to avoid blocking a proposal without outright objecting. Tuso, Kelvin, and Duresameen agreed that the reason for abstention should be stated to avoid confusion and disengagement. Tuso also warned that if we don't address these issues, we risk losing more engagement over time. Kevin asked for clarity-are abstentions a sign of disengagement, or do they actually block proposals? Vani reminded everyone that consent isn't about traditional voting; if someone doesn't object, they're effectively consenting, so abstentions without clear reasons can muddy the process.  We reflected on whether abstentions should be anonymous. Some felt that removing anonymity might make people hesitant to object, while others believed transparency could lead to more open dialogue. There was general agreement that many abstain simply due to time constraints or not fully understanding a proposal-not necessarily because they disagree. Tevo suggested we introduce a checklist for abstainers to indicate why they're sitting out-lack of time, uncertainty, or something else. Maxmilez thought tracking these reasons over time could reveal patterns and help improve the process in the long run. We also discussed broader issues, like how engagement has dropped, possibly due to lower budgets and a tough market. Some noted that while the consent process is meant to help us govern better, it's sometimes creating bottlenecks. There's also frustration that decision-making can feel inconsistent when people aren't sure what's being voted on. Tuso and others emphasized that unless we address these governance challenges, we risk stagnating as a community.  Kevin called for a focused effort to tackle these long-standing issues-especially around governance and budgeting. He suggested a dedicated workshop to finalize a model that works, while Vani Vani noted that getting our processes finalized/set in stone isn't what we are aiming for, and is arguably anti-decentralisation. Governance processes should remain livid and fluid, and we should rethink them each quarter based on retrospectives and discussions this way, new people and ideas can always influence what goes on, and it doesn't all get decentralized. Tuso and others emphasized that unless we address these governance challenges, we risk stagnating as a community. He emphasized that getting the abstention process right is key to improving engagement and decision-making.  In the course of the meeting we discussed specific options for the abstain feature in the consent process: -Remove abstain entirely, -Keep it, but add a dropdown to explain reasons,  - Or keep it as is, but improve documentation.  There was mixed feedback on whether a simple majority voting system might work better, but most were cautious about moving away from the consent model. One suggestion was to introduce a threshold-if more than 50% abstain, the topic should go back for more discussion.  On the topic of voting anonymity, opinions were split. Some supported transparency, while others thought anonymity helps newer members feel safe speaking up. A recent poll showed the group evenly divided, so this topic will need more conversation.  Budget tracking also came up-people noted that while the budget has been reduced, it's not always clear how the money is being spent. Clearer ownership and task assignments for budget items were flagged as a priority. We agreed to review the budget cap form results on Thursday and aim for final decisions by Monday. A summary of this discussion will be shared at tonight's Town Hall to get broader community input. Further conversations around abstentions and voting anonymity will continue in upcoming meetings, possibly with async discussions or polls.  The meeting wrapped up with an encouragement to join the Town Hall to stay informed and engaged in the conversation.",

        "narrative": "The workgroup convened to address multiple ongoing topics, including the debate over anonymity, budget allocations, and aligning funding with workgroup priorities. We reviewed the results of a Discord poll on anonymity, noting an almost even split (7-6) between those favoring a return to anonymity and those preferring to keep the current system. This lack of a clear consensus made it difficult to finalize a decision. Discussions reflected the complexity of balancing transparency with anonymity, recognizing that each approach carries trade-offs.  We also reviewed data on workgroup priorities, highlighting that while some workgroups-like GitHub PBL-received mostly low-priority votes, others-such as Treasury Guild-were seen as critical. The importance of cross-referencing these priorities with perceptions of under-resourcing was acknowledged, though it was agreed this could not be fully addressed in the current session. Vani raised concerns about the challenges of sharing data containing personal information, and Peter pointed out limitations in treating the small sample size as statistically significant.  Budget constraints and token price fluctuations were a central theme. We discussed whether to adjust the token rate to 32 cents to accommodate variations, though concerns were raised about fairness and the impact of such changes. It was suggested that Treasury Guild could be a logical starting point for funding discussions, given its critical role. We acknowledged the need for a clear, actionable proposal, with Tevo and Effiom volunteering to draft a budget cap suggestion over the weekend using AI tools for data analysis. We also briefly touched on the consent form draft, ensuring reasons for abstaining were included, and discussed how adjustments to voting rules might impact future decisions.  The meeting wrapped up with recognition of the progress made, despite the complex and sometimes disorganized nature of the discussion. We emphasized the importance of having a concrete proposal as a foundation for further debate and decision-making.",

Ayo also requested Martinsoki to share the summary notes from the last meeting and the agenda document.",
          "Updates on Meeting Outcomes and Budget Discussion: Ayo sought confirmation on whether LordKizzy, Gorga, Kateri, advanceameyaw, esewilliams had met, which they confirmed occurred on Saturday. CJ Frankie discussed challenges with a document and was encouraged to refer to the meeting recording for clarification. Ayo highlighted the importance of obtaining feedback from the committee before proceeding with the guild budget discussion.",
          "Discussion on Payment Structures and Tax Allocation: Advanceameyaw highlighted the importance of prioritizing tasks aligned with the Ambassador program's mission, specifically addressing AGIX payments and potential tax cuts. LordKizzy added that discussions around AGIX payments revealed inconsistencies in reward values across different workgroups, which could lead to confusion. LordKizzy outlined a proposal to restructure the Guild by splitting it into operations and initiatives teams. The operations team would manage daily activities, while the initiatives team would consist of members who can submit project proposals. Funding would be allocated based on project completion, with 75% going to the initiatives team and 25% to operations. Ayo asked committee members to write down their recommendations for Guild restructuring to facilitate clearer discussions. Kenichi highlighted the importance of unity within the Guild, arguing against splitting into two groups, as it could lead to division. He proposed that all members should pitch in ideas for initiatives collaboratively. Kareem expressed concerns about splitting the guild into two groups, suggesting that everyone should contribute to initiatives collectively. LordKizzy supported the idea of multiple groups, arguing that it would allow for better task distribution and accountability. He highlighted the importance of prioritizing low-cost initiatives due to limited funding, stating that both groups would need to work within a shared budget. Ayo emphasized the importance of maintaining unity within the guild while discussing the potential for splitting into two groups for better management. LordKizzy outlined two recommendations: one focused on restructuring payment to a conversion rate of 0.2 AGX, and the other on restructuring the guild and payment processes. The discussions included considerations of feasibility and sustainability regarding payment methods. Ayo raised questions about the timing for decisions related to the quarterly report and budget proposal, while LordKizzy clarified the submission deadline is around June 7th or 9th. The focus group plans to meet over the weekend to discuss two AGIX initiatives and their budget implications. LordKizzy emphasized the need for clarity on funding and proposed budget allocations for the initiatives.",
          "Attendance Review Discussion: Ayo highlighted the need to review attendance for the last quarter, which has not been addressed in prior meetings. Mikasa reiterated the importance of this review, expressing confusion over its connection to task completion. LordKizzy clarified that both Eric Davies and Martinsoki documented attendance and that the review would follow an assessment of task outputs. Mikasa expressed frustration over the slow progress in reviewing attendance records, which she believed should have been addressed earlier. LordKizzy explained that the attendance initiative was introduced in Q4 to address issues with deliverables and meeting participation. Mikasa volunteered to compile the attendance data for the next meeting, while Ayo highlighted the importance of punctuality in meetings to allow for more discussion time."

Peter mentioned Slate's comment on the Discord channel, noting that the survey still remains non-binding as no decisions have been made so far. He further said that during the workgroup sync call, we suggested doing another round of the survey with higher participation. Vani noted that if we use the budgets suggested by Tevo as a result of the sentiment analysis, some WGs would get significantly less budget than they would with our existing caps. She has marked these WGs in blue on Sheet 1 of the Budget Minimums spreadsheet.  Guillermo provided feedback on the analysis, he emphasized that it will be critical to have a second round so we could compare. He also noted that some workgroups and guilds are not committed to deliverables and updates during monthly Town Hall Updates , he highlighted that the analysis does not reflect this and he will appreciate seeing analysis on deliverables and output.  Peter suggested that we could do the other survey before the budget consent round, to ensure things are done well before moving forward. Tevo suggested that we could add sentiment to the consent process, as it will help target specific proposals of the workgroup/guild. Vani opt about the idea of attaching sentiment to the content process, as it will be enough for everyone to be advocating for their own group and could  prompt dishonesty for separate workgroup/guild members.  Sentiment vs Output Reality:  Tevo highlighted that low sentiment scores might result from low engagement, not poor performance. Some workgroups had minimal participant feedback, making results unreliable. Peter proposed having continuous sentiment collection to reflect changes over time, not just quarterly impressions.  Guillermo emphasized the need for output-driven strategy, not just activity. Unifying criteria across content creator groups (marketing, video, writers) would reduce redundancy and improve strategic effectiveness.He suggested that the sentiment analysis should be used to reallocate budgets towards groups with strong commitment and effective delivery, not simply sustain the status quo.  Peter suggested that groups with known reserves could reduce Q3 requests or not request at all. However, this raises fairness concerns as it might penalize honesty and reward silence.

        "narrative": "As usual, we worked from the GitHub board, starting with 'In Progress', and then to 'To Do'.  MEETING SUMMARIES We noted that meeting summaries - and tasks in this WG in general - need to be completed a bit quicker than is currently happening. Meeting summary tasks need to be done in future within a week of the date of the meeting, not several months after.  TRANSCRIPTION Most of the 'in progress' Issues on the board are transcription tasks, and were assigned in Q1. However, due to the big token price drop during Q1, we note that we were unable to afford under the Q1 budget all of the transcriptions we budgeted for in Q1. In the end, we did 5 out of the planned 15. So the outstanding ones, we have officially transferred to the Q2 budget. In Q2 we budgeted to do 11 transcriptions: 4 are done and waiting to be paid, and we agreed on a final deadline of the end of June for the other 7; but ideally, people should try to complete a little sooner, so we have time to a) check the transcripts and b) process payments by the end of the Quarter (last payment processing day this Quarter is Thurs 27th).  Q2 PAYMENTS We noted that some of the Q2 tasks - including quarterly-paid ones, such as admin tasks - have been paid or part-paid in advance now that token price is above $0.30, just in case price falls again by the end of the Quarter.  CO-CHAIR REPORT Vani gave an update on how work is going. Underlined that the core priority for the WG in future is collecting further research data - so interviewing will be a key element of the Q3 budget.  SURVEY-SHARING Survey-sharing was a paid task in Q4 2024, but should it be in future? or should people just share it if they like, withut needing to evidence it and withut being paid? Too be discussed in a future meeting, perhaps with the aim of including it in Q4 2025 budget  AI AND EMOTION DISCUSSION We noted that this discussin session, organised by Colleen as community engagement manager, took place on 19th May, and the recording is on Youtube here https://youtu.be/9QA1U40VPEg?si=_n1gIkTXFuxTK1M-  Q3 2025 BUDGET Peter pointed out that the balance between admin/overhead tasks and actual outputs (interviews, transcripts) should be more towards outputs, especially given that we have said that further interviewing is a priority for the WG next quarter. Vani agreed that the admin team are already thinking this, and that at times of lower AGIX price when there is less 'output' work going on, there is alsoo less admin/overhead work to do; so the admin team will make adjustments to the budget before it's submitted.   INTERVIEWING IN Q3 We noted that there will be budget for some interviewing during Q3, so anyone interested should start to think now  about who they would like to interview. Also, if someone new is interested in trying interviewing, Vani will be prepared to offer a bit of training, and we will have updated training materials available.",

        "narrative": "This week's session focused mainly on reviewing our current budget, identifying areas of overspend, and discussing how to move forward more realistically given the current token price and how things are evolving across workgroups.  Peter kicked things off by suggesting we dive into the budget sheet. A few minor overages came up-which initially looked like rounding errors. However, upon closer inspection, the overspend in some areas was more significant and required further attention. Some adjustments had already been made, but some still stood out as needing resolution.  Tevo explained that the increase in the Treasury Guild budget was largely due to the fact that he used the previous quarter budget and he hasn't done any recent budget for it. This change caused a noticeable jump in the numbers. He also reorganized the budget to clearly differentiate between ongoing activities and new initiatives that the extra budget would support. Regarding the Treasury Guild, Tevo admitted there hadn't been enough time to conduct the regular discussions that typically justify its expenses. As a result, that budget line appeared somewhat unclear.  Vani raised a critical question-are we now over our overall budget cap, and is this level of spending sustainable? She also asked whether the current Treasury Guild budget was based on weekly sessions, even though the team had informally shifted to a biweekly schedule. Tevo confirmed that the budget assumed weekly activity but noted that they had already begun scaling back due to tight funding. He mentioned there was no leftover budget to pull from, so instead of padding the numbers, they chose to reduce the budget request directly. With the token price being so low, he explained, it's become increasingly difficult to justify maintaining certain activities unless the structure evolves accordingly.  The idea of removing the Treasury Guild line was raised, as it hadn't been active recently. Tevo wondered if the difference between weekly and bi-weekly payments does impact the budget request. He asked if we want to have less bi-weekly treasury sessions, one month like a vacation for treasury operators, or he goes to the Swarm call to raise this up.  Guillermo joined with some reflections. He noted that while the system is currently under stress, that's not necessarily a bad thing-it presents a good opportunity to test how resilient our governance structure really is. He emphasized the importance of clearly documenting all decisions so people understand what's happening. He also suggested that not everything requires weekly meetings-monthly sessions might suffice, provided we have solid supporting materials to ensure smooth operations.  Peter asked whether a deadline should be set for core contributor nominations. Tevo didn't think a deadline was necessary but agreed it might help prompt action from those still uncertain about their roles. Demonix and UknowZork were added to the list of core contributors, though the list remains open for further nominations. Vani asked if there was anyone not yet included who should be, and suggested adding their names to the list for nominations.  During Consent form testing, Peter asked whether selecting a workgroup and seeing the 'thanks' message meant the response was already recorded. Vani clarified that it didn't-nothing is submitted until the 'Submit' button is clicked, after which users have the option to submit another response. Peter noted that users are prompted again for their email and anonymity preferences, which Vani confirmed was intentional, as collecting that data is important.  Guillermo asked for the form link, saying he couldn't find it but wanted to try it out and provide feedback. Vani shared the link in response.  We also discussed using the sentiment survey in the consent process. The goal is to ensure that feedback has a meaningful impact in Q4. Peter added that the previous round of feedback didn't go well-participation was low, and the questions lacked clarity, making the results unhelpful.  Vani also suggested using the next Town Hall to walk everyone through the governance process in a more accessible way-explaining the 'why' and 'how' behind the Consent process. Everyone agreed that this was a strong idea.  With no more pressing questions, the meeting was concluded. The hope is that once this consent round and the budget restructuring are finalized, we can shift away from heavy administrative work and return to more creative, inspiring initiatives-such as inviting builders from the ecosystem to showcase what they're working on. For now, though, the focus remains on tightening operations and improving transparency.",

        "narrative": "The meeting began with a continuation of the conversation from the last session on the earning gap, specifically from the standpoint of task types.  We began by reviewing the Treasury Dashboard to understand how funds are distributed across various workgroups and guilds, and how their associated tasks are labeled and categorized. During this review, several inconsistencies emerged in the taxonomy, with overlapping or duplicate labels like 'documenting' and 'documentation.' These inconsistencies make it difficult to conduct a reliable analysis of spending patterns.  This led to a broader discussion on how budgets are being divided, particularly how much is being spent on administrative functions like facilitation, documentation, managing task on dework and coordination. Estimates suggested that nearly 50% of some workgroup budgets go to admin tasks, sparking debate on whether this is justifiable or excessive. While some saw this as potentially excessive, others defended the need that such overhead is vital.  Another area of concern was the high cost of Dework task management, across the ecosystem. Vani pointed out that task management includes more than logging activities, it involves quality control, follow-ups, and support. She also highlighted that over-reliance on time tracking could create pressure and disadvantage contributors who operate at different speeds.  This led to a broader exploration of how to meaningfully distinguish administrative tasks from operational ones. Tevo suggested launching a survey to collect definitions of administrative work from community members, but Vani suggested using a Google document, that it would lead to more consistent and transparent outcomes.  In wrapping up, Peter recognized that the Q3 budgeting cycle is too far along to implement changes now, but will likely affect the Q4 budget.",

All Workgroups passed the quorum threshold, which was set at 17%. The Workgroup with the lowest interaction was the Knowledge Base, with 10 contributors per consent, but it still met the quorum requirement.  We all noted the progress made in this quarter's Consent Process-33 people participated, marking a clear increase from the previous quarter.  We then reviewed the Workgroups that received objections to determine whether those objections were valid. Several key themes that emerged were whether Workgroups are evidencing their impact/outcomes - whether groups have unallocated reserves that they should be spending; and whether WGs have a clear 'roadmap' of what they intend to do.  Vani noted that it is up to the Workgroups to decide whether they want to respond to the objections. She also emphasized the need to track recurring issues and include them in our reports. She proposed adding a new agenda item: 'How do we handle objections that cannot be resolved within the timeframe of the Consent Process?' Peter supported the idea, saying it would be valuable to have that discussion.  Slate raised a question about how Workgroups should respond to objections. Both Peter and Vani responded, stating that a clear document outlining the objections should suffice.   For Consent Round 2 (same as last quarter) we concluded that no new objections may be raised. However, contributors can object to a Workgroup they've previously consented to if they now agree with existing objections, They can also consent to a Workgroup that they've previously objected to if they feel that the Workgroup have adequately addressed the issues.  Kateri also shared in the chat that she believes Workgroups should make it a priority to attend the monthly sync meetings. This would help members stay informed about ongoing progress and gain insights into each guild's work.  We discussed anonymity in the Consent Process and learned that only 23.7% of contributors were uncomfortable with the lack of anonymization. Vani asked whether we are still planning to conduct sentiment analysis for the ongoing Consent Process. Peter responded that while it would be beneficial, he's unsure if it can be integrated during the current process.  Wrapping up Peter also suggested that, moving forward, we should schedule the first Consent Process results meeting for two hours instead of one.",

We also revisited a pending discussion on disparities between high and lower earners in the community. Regarding the plan to create a Google Form to gather input from lower earners, Peter suggested discussing the form questions asynchronously in the Discord channel before proceeding.  The conversation then shifted to how objections can be effectively tracked and followed up on from quarter to quarter. Vani pointed out a recurring pattern where certain issues are raised repeatedly in one quarter, disappear the next, and then resurface later. She emphasized the importance of systematically tracking these objections and shared several documents from previous quarters that attempt to capture this feedback.  On objection tracking, Vani referenced several past documents and retrospectives and emphasized the need to collate them. She proposed a spreadsheet organized workgroup by workgroup and quarter by quarter, though acknowledged the effort required. She noted that it was necessary  to extract relevant working document from our documentation archives. The idea of using a spreadsheet to track objections over time was also proposed, with Peter suggesting the governance dashboard for streamlined tracking.  We continued an ongoing discussion about how to address work group outputs that may not meet quality standards. The conversation focused on creating a safe and constructive environment for feedback, separate from the formal budget consent process. The group agreed that linking feedback on work quality directly to budget approval can make work groups feel their funding is under threat, which may discourage open dialogue. Love highlighted the lack of a neutral space for offering feedback, while Guillermo shared that he has found external insights valuable in improving his work. Vani reiterated the previously raised idea of implementing a quarterly anonymous feedback mechanism to encourage honest, depersonalized input.  The group then discussed the importance of setting guidelines for constructive feedback. Love emphasized that feedback should focus on the effectiveness of contributions, not minor imperfections. Vani agreed, cautioning against nitpicking and encouraging feedback that connects to prior concerns or repeated patterns.  Finally, Vani highlighted the importance of understanding the value of the work group's initiatives, noting that many comments have emerged during the consent process. Love supported the idea of soliciting feedback from a broader audience, while Guillermo suggested incorporating this feedback into the sentiment analysis they are refurbishing. They agreed to craft a post to gather opinions before finalizing any decisions",

        "narrative": "Guillermo began his presentation by clarifying the importance of a soft launch for the governance system dashboard emphasizing the need for initial debugging and testing before fully integrating it into the live consent process. He explained that the system was already live and began walking through it with a screen share. He demonstrated the login process, which currently uses Discord as the authentication method, though integrations with Google and others may follow. The login leads to a platform where users have distinct roles like Super Admins, Admins, Core Contributors, and Community Members. Each role has defined access levels. For example, community members can read and submit proposals but cannot vote in the consent process.  Guillermo noted that what was being shown was a draft and not a final. He demonstrated how core contributors can navigate the system: logging in, accessing the dashboard, and interacting with different sections like Education, Documentation, and Proposals. The proposal section is functional, with the ability to comment and vote, offering upvotes, abstentions, and downvotes. Comments can be categorized as suggestions, concerns, or arguments, using a checkbox system. However, he mentioned issues raised during R&D discussions, like mismatches between selected checkboxes and the rationale provided.   The platform structure allows for quarterly instances like Q4 Reports. Each workgroup will submit a proposal representing their report, budget, and key contributions. These proposals will be archived and displayed under specific instances in the dashboard. Guillermo showed an example test proposal from the R&D group, which included integrated links and structured content. Although some data had been reset due to development iterations, he reiterated that the platform is ready to demonstrate proposal creation and voting flow later in Town Hall.  He then introduced the collaboration and skill database, describing it as an interactive platform where users can create profiles with bios, selected workgroups, skills, and other metadata like language and location. This directory will allow searching by name or workgroup and enable profile editing, image uploading, CV attachment, and future messaging features. He highlighted that availability status, wallet address options, and tagging workgroup affiliations were in place. Vani raised a wallet address privacy concern. She stated that it shouldn't be a piece of public information. Guillermo addressed the concerns stating that while the system architecture supports wallet integration, it will be phased in later and it will respect user privacy preferences. Only core contributors will have access to certain governance functionalities, and visibility settings will be configurable.  Guillermo emphasized the importance of keeping the platform practical and building only what is useful. He noted that the second round of consent he participated in helped shape the platform's design and features. When a workgroup lead creates a proposal, they will be able to edit it, track changes, and register revisions with timestamps. More than one representative per workgroup will be permitted to input proposals to avoid bottlenecks.  Moving to visuals, Guillermo showed a Figma design mockup of the platform. The left navigation highlights active instances like Q4 reports. Each proposal page is represented with icons, comment counts, and contributors. He noted that Educational content, status indicators, and embedded infographics will support the consent process. He explained how voting will be done via a pop-up selection (e.g., object, consent, abstain) with rationale input captured in the database rather than Google Forms.  He also shared an organizational chart labeling workgroups based on their focus-Education, Communication, and Strategy explaining that while he doesn't favor rigid segmentation, this visual helps identify overlap and strategic alignment. He asked for feedback on what was missing, what should be removed, and what could be improved.  Guillermo emphasized that while the platform's architecture is solid, its value depends on collaborative input and refinement. He reminded the group that contributions like tasks, suggestions, or ideas should be valued and that a consistent taxonomy and task-labeling system could improve both visibility and budgeting clarity. For instance, showing the proportion of funds spent on different categories (admin, outreach, and the like) would help strategic planning.  He closed with reflections on integrating other tools like GitHub or DeWork, noting that the inconsistency in how teams document tasks make standardized integration difficult. Nonetheless, the system being built could evolve into a broader contribution-tracking model, not just for governance but for the entire community's work. He concluded with light humor about pulling this all together with minimal resources but with optimism for improving it in the next test phase.  With a few minutes remaining in the session, Peter brought up the need to create a facilitation schedule for the upcoming months, noting that planning currently ends after this week. He proposed a simple rotation system, given there are two governance meetings per week, and he invited attendees to indicate their interest in facilitating either by raising hands or using the chat.  Vani helped prompt volunteers, mentioning names like Alfred, Maxmilez, and UknowZork, who were already in the facilitation rotation. She offered to compile the list and update the facilitation sheet. She also asked Advance if he was up for it which he stated that he would not be able to due to his busy and tight schedule while Éveline tentatively expressed interest in the future.  Peter noted that we already have five names, enough to cover the first five sessions of the next quarter. As the meeting wrapped up Peter asked if there were any final topics to address. Vani informed the group that she wouldn't be able to attend the upcoming Town Hall and that others might need to cover her usual workgroup reports.  The session closed with thanks to Guillermo for his dashboard demo. Guillermo apologized for any messiness but expressed optimism about the system's progress. The meeting came to an end with Peter reminding the workgroup to attend the Town Hall that was scheduled for later today.",

        "narrative": "Vani opened the discussion by reflecting on the Education Guild's consent process. While the guild received enough consents and only two objections and abstentions, there were lingering concerns raised. She questioned whether these concerns should be taken back to the guild or at least logged for future tracking. One objection claimed their points weren't addressed, while others seemed satisfied. There was confusion over the Education Guild's role regarding the governance framework. Some thought they were proposing one, but in reality, they were planning to educate people about the existing one. Vani emphasized that misunderstandings were likely the root of most concerns. A similar issue arose with a lack of clarity about their Q2/Q3 budget reporting. Vani suggested that moving forward, guilds should present clearer documentation, especially regarding budget allocations and rewards distribution.  The Gamers work group faced one objection and some similar concerns about missing rationale and links, again pointing to the importance of clearer reporting rather than any failure in delivery. Marketing, however, raised more concern. Although they technically passed, the number of abstentions suggested unease. Comments noted inconsistencies in data, unclear calculations, and a perceived overspend on tasks. Vani raised the ongoing issue of how time and task pricing are evaluated reminding us that many guilds pay per task, not per hour. There was also criticism around analytics and outcome clarity, with a call for a better interpretation of marketing impact.  R&D received two objections and six abstentions, mostly due to misunderstandings. Objections to uncertain budget items ignored the fact that some of their funds are determined by community voting. Vani argued that the objection should've been marked invalid more clearly, as R&D had explained their internal mini-funding process. Some feedback confused Q2 and Q3 timelines. She noted that clearer communication and more accurate tracking could have prevented those abstentions.  The Strategy Guild only reached 50% consent. Though technically passing, Vani called attention to fundamental concerns, especially around the usefulness of their work and lack of responses to objections. Some budget lines lacked reporting or were vaguely deferred. Concerns were not adequately acknowledged, suggesting a deeper issue with engagement and transparency.  The Translation work group faced objections due to misunderstandings again. Some believed only four translations were delivered, while the real number (considering multiple languages) was far higher. Vani admitted she forgot to list an objection regarding AI alternatives for translation. Still, most abstentions stemmed from not reading the explanation in the shared sheets.  Video Work Group received three objections and three abstentions. The main concern was producing content that was not being viewed. The lack of responses to feedback also stood out. Writers Work Group had notable discomfort around reward distribution, particularly to one individual. Another concern was the disproportionately high reward for management versus content creation.  Peter joined, emphasizing the need to keep tracking objections across quarters. He noted that there is already a Q3 objection summary document, and he suggested continuing this practice to ensure consistency. However, he raised a concern about work groups dismissing objections as invalid without explanation. Even if technically allowed, it's more productive to acknowledge and respond to them. He noted that only a few groups (marketing, gamers, education) submitted proper documents addressing concerns.  Vani speculated that some work groups may not bother responding because they're confident they'll hit the 80% consent threshold anyway. This points to potential flaws in the structure of the consent process.  Love suggested distinguishing between new and recurring concerns and recommended that repeated issues across quarters should trigger a mandatory response. If multiple people consistently raise the same issue, it must be taken seriously, regardless of how it's phrased.  Peter agreed and added that while the objections are being documented, the process needs better integration. Vani noted that repeated concerns are often phrased slightly differently, making them hard to track unless analyzed carefully. Peter mentioned that the dropdown tags introduced to categorize issues aren't always being used correctly.  Peter admitted this topic hasn't been treated with urgency, and some issues are still unresolved. He proposed using the remaining time to map out future topics and planning. Vani supported this, noting some themes like work quality have been brought up repeatedly but still lack a defined process. She proposed setting a date for these topics and having facilitators come prepared with summaries and the next steps.  Peter suggested syncing workgroup updates on Mondays and asked if it should be mandatory for workgroups to share regular updates. Maxmilez agreed and stressed that workgroups should be required to give updates at Town Hall meetings.  Guillermo added that internal and external communication around updates must be improved. He shared that the new governance dashboard will help track contributions and concerns, but more work is needed, particularly around defining 'contributions' and 'participation.' He suggested holding a dedicated meeting to refine these concepts.  Peter and Guillermo both agreed that tracking concerns, especially repeated ones, must become automated and linked with the governance tool. They also emphasized that the purpose of the consent process should not be just symbolic it must have the power to trigger real consequences. They asked that if every work group gets funding every time, what's the process achieving?  Vani reflected on this and said perhaps the consent process is being treated more as an informational tool rather than a regulatory one. That could be a danger, especially if bad actions ever enter the system. She noted that repeated issues with no accountability can lead to exploitation. She also suggested that we may be organically shifting toward a consensus-based model for decision making one that relies more on collective understanding than just voting thresholds.  Peter acknowledged a message in the chat that emphasized the difference between outcomes and outputs, pointing out that Vani had been the most consistent advocate for clarifying that distinction. He shifted the conversation toward organizing upcoming agenda topics. He asked whether the group should try planning multiple sessions, or if some topics should take priority outside the already scheduled retrospective. He suggested that the top two items on the agenda felt like high-priority ('level one') issues, but also noted that high priority doesn't necessarily mean they must be discussed first. For example, he believed the discussion on workgroup syncing could be handled quickly though he admitted he might be biased.  Vani proposed reviving the facilitation roster and letting people volunteer to facilitate specific upcoming topics. She suggested attaching names to topics as a way to organically schedule discussions. In response, Peter observed that UknowZork, Alfred, and Guillermo had already volunteered to facilitate one of the sessions. Vani then claimed the Outcomes vs Outputs topic, proposing it be scheduled toward the end of July rather than as the next immediate session.  Peter agreed and began rearranging the schedule accordingly. He asked which topic should be next week's focus and said he would finalize the timeline after the call. He suggested the Recurring Concerns topic might be a natural follow-up to the Retrospective, and asked Vani if she wanted to lead it. Vani agreed, saying she had already been looking into recurring objections and might have something concrete to present by then. With no objections or strong alternative suggestions from others, Peter confirmed the plan to proceed with that sequence. He then reopened the topic of anonymity, noting that while the current feedback process isn't anonymous, some participants have expressed concerns that this might reduce openness. He proposed the group should agree on a default approach for the next quarter and stick with it until there's consensus to change.  Peter noted this is a larger topic than could be addressed fully in the meeting, which had already run over time. He wrapped up by pointing out that most contributions were made by only a few people and encouraged broader participation in future discussions. He reminded everyone that the governance topic list is open for anyone to contribute to and dropped the editable link in the chat.  With no further input, the meeting concluded, and Peter reminded attendees of upcoming sessions, including the African Guild call.",

We did a prioritising activity on the ideas - each person selected up to 5 favourite ideas, in order from best to worst, and copy-pasted them into the Miro under their name; then selected one or more ideas they felt were questionable or that they would prefer NOT to do. You can see the results at the bottom of the Miro board.   (Note on Miro usage: not everyone did the activity - some people find it hard to access Miro, either due to poor Internet connectivity, or because Miro can be fiddly to use on a phone. Some people did post the numbers of their selected ideas in Chat, and someone else did it for them on the Miro booard.)  We then discussed the responses. For key points, see 'decisions' below  There was some discussion on the idea of focusing on quality, not quantity, and minimising the activity of WGs which are not achieving 'quality'. On the questioon of how we define 'quality' - there may be a need for greater clarity on WGs' purpose/aims. Each WG could be asked to define what they're *trying* to achieve, so that we can then assess whether they're achieving it.

Hard to tell if people are witholding opinions because of it, so we probably need to ask people.  WENT WELL: - Removal of self-nomination: no issues were noticed - Each WG writing a dedicated doc to respond to objections seems to work - we could ask people to start writing those docs straight after Round 1 - It worked well to not allow any new objections in Round 2 - Quarterly reports are improving - Our budgets are small, which minimiuses the tensions in the budget process - Budget caps is still reducing the time spent on the consent proocess, and working well - Deadlines went well - people got budgets in on time  DIDN'T GO WELL: - Process of addressing objections could be improved. Reading objections out in a meeting is not very engaging; but if we discuss objections in a meeting, we used entire meeting time to address objections on just one WG. And asynchronous processes are not working smoothly.  - After the first round there were too many meetings before we progressed to next stage - Much lower numbers of Core Contributors taking part compared to usual - aound 16 people?.  - How we treat abstentions - people are using them as a 'soft object' but we're ignoring abstentions completely. Is non-anonymity a factor - are peoople abstaining because they don't feel comfortable to object when everyone knows who they are? - Feels like we are not really encouraging objections - we rushed through them, and there was some almost 'eyerolling' - The process has no teeth - whatever objections are made, people get their budgets (although perhaps that's the right approach?) This might be an effect of the 80/20% rule - nobody is likely to get 20% objection, especially not when people abstain rather than objecting - Budgets seem detached from reports - Relevant actions or assets are not included in Quarterly or Budget Reports - Using USD value for rewarding tasks - it has an impact in volatile market - Some WGs' budgets don't improve over iterations - the budget items don't change that much in detail after a few iterations  SUGGESTIONS - We need to ask people who did not take part, why they didn't - and whether no anonymity was a factor - Implement a quorum? - Find clearer ways to track objections - Reassess what 'I abstain' means - maybe ask in the form itself why people are abstaining - Look at whether we have a climate where it feels safe to object / what we could do to make it feel safer - Refine the consent form so that it's clear what people's objection is, so we can let go of the idea that objectors need to be present in order for us to discuss the objection - proposal budgets should match more with reports - more clarity on what we are measuring and why - budget sheets themselves need more detail. - Should we use the 80/20% rule for the first round of objections as well as the 2nd round?   As this is a retrospective, people simply shared their perspectives, and there were no decisions made; but in the 'Decision' section below are things we agreed to discuss further in Governance meetings",

We need to find out.  - Monthly TH updates - if everyone attended, they'd only get a couple of minutes each. - Are people not attending because they don't get time too say anything? - Do people find it boring? Are they listening to what's said? - We have quarterly reports - isn't that enough reporting? - Are quarterly reports more internal, and TH Updates more outward facing? (Maybe not - view counts are pretty low) - Can we try a different approach for a while - people only present if they have something specific to share?  - End of Year report - it's quite old now, so we can't really make a splash about it - but people worked hard on it. What happened? Need to ask Writers' WG why it didn't go oout. - When the new Ambassadors website goes up, we could put it there, without making a massive splash about it.  - Rethink of overall premise of Ambassador Program - feels like something that needs a meeting of its own.  - And it needs to be facilitated in an engaging and participatory way, to help overcome barriers like pooor Internet connections and make sure everyone's heard.  For example: have a shared doc that people can contribute to in advance of the meeting. - We'll set up a 'mission-and-vision' session, and invite a small group to be part of planning it.   - Ambassador social media accounts: the suggestion is that they should do less content-creatioon, and more amplifying of content created elsewhere in the ecosystem; make sure to attribute and namecheck people; and try to engage more with followers - discussions, etc - rather than just giving information - Maybe use Mindplex more?  - This meeting felt that an overall communications strategy might be what is needed - Regional Guilds (LatAm, African) might be able to help, as they have some goood strategies - But important that the content-creation WGs (Writers, Video, Marketing) are strongly involved - not least because of WG autonomy. - We'll ask them if they think it would be a good idea.  - Do we need WGs for a) external fundraising and b) selling our skills and tools as a service?  - We didn't have time for much discussion, but agreed to take it to Governance WG",

Discussion on Addressing Recurring Objections and Workgroup Reserves: Addressing Recurring Objections and Workgroup Reserves; WGs having recurring objections can be invited for a meeting with the governance have a fair discussions to understand the reason for the recurring objections from the past quarter to be able to find a lasting solution, seeing Governance as the right platform to have such meeting.  Discussion on Work Group Outcomes and Governance: Quality of work and output:  the reason most of the questions on quality of work and output surfaces most times might be due to not having clarity on outcomes of most contents and most times it is difficult to point it out.   Discussion on Outcomes vs. Outputs in Budget Approvals: WGs should point out the details of what they are doing and the outcomes giving examples of content creation and the engagement they have had and the content shared on social media platforms. Quarterly reports should point out the effects of what WGs have achieved at the end of every quarter and what they plan to achieve in the quarter ahead as they are to put more concentration on outcomes than outputs and KPIS.  R&D Challenges and Improvement Strategies: The R&D Guild as an example of failing on different experiments and after every failure observed there is always a room for correction and coming up with new Ideas and making sure it's been addressed and more effort is been put in place to make sure it succeeds.  Collaborative Approaches to Workgroup Challenges: We believe  if there will be by any means a follow-up on WGs and Guilds to address issues that keep coming up And also having outcomes in the balance sheet of tokens spent every quarter  to avoid same issues coming up over again. (Just a thought)  Decision-Making Framework and Work Group Participation: We should find a way in having WGs collaborate whereby members of other WGs are allowed to look into each other's work and effort and try to find a way in making every task accomplished and also have a better outcome, at least it will help also.",

        "narrative": "In this session we explored alternative ways to support and fund the work happening within the Ambassador Programme, especially given the limitations of the current budget. Vani kicked things off by sharing a spreadsheet of ideas, including a few promising grant opportunities like an EU initiative focused on AI for Africa. She suggested subscribing to a grant database (for about €99 a year) to help surface more of these opportunities. The group was open to it, though some felt it would be good to first confirm eligibility requirements and whether it's worth the cost.  There was a broader discussion about making sure workgroups are actively tracking funding opportunities things like RFPs and hackathons and whether someone should be tasked with flagging relevant calls to each group. People agreed that otherwise, chances could easily be missed. A few ideas were thrown around: setting up a Discord channel for deep funding updates, encouraging groups to keep 'back burner' projects ready in case the right opportunity comes up, and even suggesting each workgroup think more strategically about what they'd pitch if the funding stars aligned.  The conversation then turned to a big question: could the community actually sell some of its services like Archive tool, governance tools to other projects or ecosystems? While intriguing at first, several people (including Tevo and Guillermo) raised valid concerns. Would these services be useful to outsiders? Who would actually benefit from the income? Would it support the broader mission, or just become freelance gigs for a few individuals?   Instead, we began to align around the idea of external fundraising not just for the Ambassador Programme itself, but to help workgroups find the resources they need to grow and evolve. That led to a concrete proposal: what if a temporary fundraising workgroup was formed? A team that could help identify grants, write applications, and guide other contributors through the process? Guillermo emphasized the importance of tying this work to actual results and having clear systems to show impact, especially as tools like the governance dashboard and archive system start to take shape. Some viewed it as a win, since it means people are growing, moving forward, and still contributing to the larger ecosystem. Either way, it reinforced the importance of having solid onboarding in place to keep fresh contributors coming in.  Vani and Peter floated the idea of a trial: set aside a modest budget (somewhere between $600 and $3,000, sourced from reserves), run the fundraising workgroup in Q4, and see how it goes. We discussed what kind of people should be involved ideally those with experience writing successful funding proposals, but also room for newer people who are willing to learn and contribute.  Before wrapping up, there were a few last questions: Should we focus only on deep funding, or cast a wider net? Should we reinstate the 'New Ideas Budget' from reserves to test the project? How do we fairly select who leads this effort? Everyone was broadly supportive, and the next steps will likely include drafting a clear proposal outlining the scope, timeline, goals, and how success will be measured then circulating it for community feedback and consents.",

For the unfinished Q2 transcription tasks (aside from Colleen's), we've decided to fold them into the admin roles so they won't receive payment for them. The transcription needs to get done by the end of July, as we are a bit firm with deadlines now. After further discussion from the Admin Team, we agreed that; The WG needs to complete tasks quicker - things should not drag on for several months, and should at the very least be completed during the Quarter they are funded in. Deadlines need to be set to allow time for tasks to be reassigned if the original assignee doesn't have time to complete them. We need to be clearer that tasks will be reassigned if they're not completed by the deadline. Going forward, no task will be paid during a Quarter if the token price is below the price at which the budget was calculated (so for Q3 2025, that's $0.30). If the token price stays below $0.30 for the whole Quarter, then at the end of the Quarter, we will assess what we can't pay. Priority will be given to 'output-based' tasks done by members, rather than admin roles. We decided to change things up now because at first, we wanted people to get used to carrying out tasks in the WG. Training materials have been revised and updated by Vani. Links here:Interview training AI Ethics WG; BGI Nexus Interviewers' handbook; Transcription training AI Ethics WG Transcript Checking is ongoing and currently being done by Vani. AI Ethics MOOC Study Group: The idea is to register for a free course on AI Ethics and meet weekly to discuss each module and the issues it raises. The most popular course is the 'EdinburghX's Data Ethics, AI and Responsible Innovation' but interested people in the study group need to finish the course by the 11th of August so they don't lose free access to it. The time for the weekly meet will be sorted out async. Course Link here: https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/the-university-of-edinburgh-data-ethics-ai-and-responsible-innovation  Interviews: We've budgeted for 8 new half-hour interviews this quarter but we didn't include expenses so might have to take money from the budget for transcription tasks this quarter. Deadline for all Q3 interviews will be the 8th of August, any interview not done by then can either be reassigned or put the money back in the WG purse. The assignees so far are Clement(2x), Grandi(2x), UknowZork(2x), Rems, and Jeffery. Interview Transcription: We might not get to do any Q3 transcriptions because we have to clear out the backlog from last quarter. Deadline to finish up old transcripts is the 31st of July. People up for transcripts are Clement, UknowZork, Jeffrey, Ashley, Barnabas, AdvanceAmeyaw, Maximilez, and Grandi.",

The call opened  with updates on payments, noting that several completed tasks are still waiting because of the low AGIX token price. Everyone was reminded that contributors will be paid by the end of the quarter regardless, with the admin team covering the shortfall if needed. Documentation for this meeting was assigned to Zork, with the reminder that it should be completed and submitted by September 7. When we reviewed the Github board, a question came up about whether anything should be raised in the upcoming workgroup sync call. Nobody had urgent items, but it was agreed that the BGI Nexus survey should continue to be highlighted. A discussion followed on possible involvement at BGI25 in Istanbul. Ideas included hosting a virtual event beforehand to showcase the research interviews, transcriptions, and survey data. Vani mentioned that more clarity would come after a check-in with Esther and Hayley later in the week. On the community engagement side, Vani mentioned that  Colleen's 'Redefining Intelligence' session had technical glitches but was successfully repeated in the AI Sandbox. A recording and slides will be shared and a new participant, Julian, has also suggested topics and may become involved in the future. Sucre gave an update on internal management: the project board is organized, the Q4 budget draft has been prepared, and the quarterly report is underway. Payments are still delayed by token price, but there's hope that some will be processed by Thursday. The MOOC study group on AI ethics was briefly revisited, but the feeling was that workloads are too heavy now. The idea will be reassessed in the October meeting. We checked the progress on transcripts. Vani noted that Q2 transcript checking is still ongoing but close to completion, while Q3 transcripts are partially done. The backlog remains a priority.  In connection with BGI25, we talked about how the workgroup might contribute, perhaps through a roundtable or presentation tied to ongoing research. Everyone was invited to suggest subtopics or relevant topics before the Thursday meeting with Esther and Hayley. The budget review prompted discussion on necessary cuts. Documentation payments were reduced to $20, co-chair to $250, and management roles to $150. Only three new interviews are planned for Q4 (alongside Jeffrey's completed one), with most of the budget going toward 14 transcriptions. Other allocations included transcript checking, two trial research write-ups, possible grounded theory coding, Colleen's monthly events, and a contingency fund. AI Ethics WG budget: Quarter 4 2025 Members then exchanged views on who wanted to take on tasks. Zork, Clement, Grandi, and Advance confirmed willingness to do transcriptions. Alfred, MaxMilez, Zork, and Rems offered to handle interviews. We agreed to finalize preferences by commenting directly on the draft budget sheet. There was clarification around grounded theory coding that was stated in the Q4 budget analysis: it refers to qualitative data analysis, not programming. The idea is to treat it as a learning opportunity, possibly unpaid unless strong interest develops.",

        "narrative": "1) Interview Issues  Vani has checked most of the interviews for validity.  Some have been sent for payment; others have some issues e.g. incorrect filenames, too short, no consent forms, etc.  See individual interview Issues on the GitHub board for details. The rest will be checked by the end of the Quarter.  Payments will only be made if interviews meet the agreed validity criteria. We note that a short interview could still be included in the research corpus, provided there is a consent form for it - but in terms of WG payment, we have agreed that interviews should be 30 mins, so ones that are significantly shorter will be paid less. A sliding scale has been devised by the Admin team for interviews that are too short. See https://github.com/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/AI-Ethics-Workgroup/issues/117  We noted that regardless of interview validity, any expenses incurred by interviewees will still be paid.  What we've learned on interviewing:   - We have noticed some difficulties for people working in a 2nd language - BGI Nexus will consider whether it is possible in future for interviews to be in languages other than English. - It is helpful to make a habit (as Clement did in his interviews) of avoiding any personally-identifiable info on the recording - e.g. not using the interviewee's name after the initial intro, etc. It makes anonymising easier if it's only the start of the interview that needs to be removed. - We need a more uniform approach to explaining who the organisation is that's doing the interviews - the nested 'sNET/BGI Nexus/ Ambassadors/ AI Ethics WG' can be a bit of a mouthful! Vani will add a suggestion for what to say to the training slides and Interviewers' Handbook. - For group interviews, a consent form is needed for each person. Use the same identifier code, but with 'a' 'b' 'c' on the end.   - Selection of interviewees - we have found that it's best to choose people who have something to say. interviews with people who know nothing at all about AI have been difficult. But for future interviews, we could give some thought (perhaps in the flothcoming interviewers' plenary session) to how best to approach interviewees with no or very little knowledge of AI, so we can include them in our research.   2) AI Ethics Discord Forum We agreed that since the forum isn't being very widely used, we will suspend paying for moderation of it next Quarter. The overal Discord moderation will pick up any problem posts.   3) WG Sync Call We will mention the planned discussion with CollyPride on March 24th   4) Upcoming training sessions Esther will run a plenary session / peer learning session for interviewers before the end of the Quarter (i.e before end March) to gather insights on how interviewing has gone so far, and enable updating of the interviewer learning materials to reflect our context.  Vani will run training in transcription skills as soon as possible - we have budgeted for transcription tasks in this Quarter, so if the training can take place soon, there might be time for people to do some transcriptionwork before the ned of the Quarter - although with token price so low, we will almost certainly have to defer some of the se tasks to next Quarter.   5) Q2 2025 budget This will be submitted by 10th March. Due to low token price, it is quite minimal, and will focus mainly on transcription tasks. Some of the planned transcriptions we budgeted for in q1 will need to be tranferred to Q2 due to the drop in token price.  We noted that in this Quarter (Q1) we originally budgeted to do 33 new interviews. The drop in token price has meant we have had to reduce this to 15; and in Q2, we will not be able to afford to budget for any new interviews - the WG admin team has agreed it's best to focus on transcriptions this Quarter, so we stay 'caught up' and don't accumulate a huge backlog of untranscribed interview material.",

Vani brought up a recent Discord discussion about Tevo's difficulty managing payments outside the quarterly allocation, stressing the need for a clearer system to track and confirm agreements each quarter. She also mentioned Tevo's new GitHub integration, which could reduce reliance on Dework.   Guillermo walked us through the governance dashboard tool. He emphasized functionality and mobile usability over styling, showing how proposals would be created by copying reports from Google Docs to keep workflows open and flexible. He demonstrated how budgets and links would be added, how proposals would appear, and how the consent/objection process would work  Improvements suggested: - 'consent' not 'voting' - displaying document titles instead of raw links  We discussed how the dashboard will handle the second round consent process.   We discussed what analytics should be tracked: see Guillermo's analytics doc. Suggestions included: - participation patterns - number of abstentions - how often particular objections recur for a WG over time (would need input of historic data, and is therefore something for a 2nd iteration rather than something that can be implemented immediately - demographics (but with a caution that the Dashboard only collects data about country and language, and only if the user chooses to add that to their profile, so data might not be very complete; also, there are many kinds of diversity (sex? sexuality? disability? etc) that we're not collecting any data on, and probably wouldn't due to privacy concerns; so we should be wary of thinking that just 'country' and 'language' cover all the exclusions and barriers that people face.)   Alfred asked about dashboard formatting, and Guillermo explained that Google Docs would remain the main space for editing before content is imported into the tool.  We noted that the Dashboard makes the consent process non-anonymous; Guillermo noted that other forms of opinion gathering, such as sentiment surveys like the recent one in July/August, can also be used in future to supplement the consent process, and would almost certainly be anonymous.   We noted that the development team will be producing 'how-to' materials such as walkthru videos, and agreed that GovWG will help to share them.",

        "discussion": "1) Change to consent process timeline  The new dashboard's commenting feature encourages people to comment on budgets and reports, and allows WGs to amend them in response. So the consent process cannot start until this process is finished, to prevent changes after consent is given. To accommodate this, a new timeline with a single consent round was agreed: see 'decisions' below.  We noted that this does not mean the second round is removed forever.   2)Integration of historical data into the Governance dashboard  It would be useful to add past objections and other historical data into the new dashboard, as recurring issues are revealing. Migrating all data would be a significant effort. Could start with the most recent (Q2/3) data  Could allocate a budget from Ambassador reserves for the task. To be discussed further in a future meeting.   3) Verifying the validity of objections  The proposed timeline includes a focus group to check if objections are valid before they are discussed in the Governance WG meeting. Alfred raised concerns about a small, unelected group making decisions and suggested representation from all workgroups to ensure fairness. But it was pointed out to him that the validity check does *not* involve 'making decisions', but simply scanning for any potential invalidities, and the assessment is ratified or not in the Governance meeting. We agreed to make the validity check an open session where anyone can participate, rather than a pre-selected focus group. It was clarified that the role of this session is simply to check if an objection is valid, not to comment on how the objection should be resolved.   4) 80-20% rule  In past consent rounds, this rule has been applied in the 2nd round, so that a single objection cannot hold up the process indefinitely. As we no longer have a 2nd round, the rule might be inapproriate, as it would silence minority objections before they could be discussed. We agreed all objections will be discussed; and the 80/20 rule will only be applied if agreement cannot otherwise be reached.    5) Definition of consent decisionmaking  In response to a question from Ayomi, the consent process was explained.   - Consenting to a budget does not mean that you think it is perfect; just that it is 'safe enough to try'.  - Objections should not be the objewctor's own ideas for how things could be done better - an objection must identify actual, specific harm that would be caused if a proposal was carried out.  - The process then focuses on resolving objections by asking objectors what would need to change in order to get their consent.",

But we noted that the ongoing issues with summary quality seem to be worsening - particularly, vague and meaningless content (e.g. 'We made a decision on XYZ' without saying what the decision was), and over-focus of the idea of a 'meeting narrative' leading to undue emphasis on inconsequential details, and failure to record actual decisions.  We noted that this might need to be addressed eventually if the corpus is not to become irretrievably corrupt. However, we need to see the results of our knowledge graphs to fully assess the extent of the problem - can a graph derive meaningful and accurate insights despite inadequate summaries?",

        "narrative": "1) Q4 2025 exchange rate This Quarter's rate of $0.30 may be too high - token price has been closer to 27-28 cents, so sticking with 30 cents would constantly leave everyone short; but dropping it lower might squeeze budgets too much. People shared their thoughts, with suggestions ranging from 25 to 30 cents. After some back and forth, the room settled on 28 cents as a fair middle ground that wouldn't be too risky or too harsh on project funding.  2) Governance Dashboard Guillermo confirmed it will be ready in time for the start of the consent process, so we confirmed that it will be used.  3) Consent process timeline The original deadline for budget submissions was set for September 8th, but since the new governance dashboard still needs testing and orientation sessions, everyone agreed to push it back a week to September 15th. The extra time will give workgroups a chance to learn how to use the new system without rushing.  4) Additions to what should be included in budget and reports In previous GovWG meetings this Quarter we have agreed several changes, which we confirmed. WGs should include  - percentage breakdown of how much of their budget is admin costs vs how much is outputs (mandatory)  - amount of unallocated reserves (mandatory) - a 'reflection' section in reports on what could have gone better (optional) - a few lines about the purpose/aim of the WG (optional) - some information about this quarter's outcomes, not just outputs (optional)  5) Context-setting documents Colleen offered to take on updating these. Guillermo pointed out that much of the tracking would already be managed automatically by the dashboard. The group agreed it would still be helpful to have some guidance in place, but they emphasized not wanting the process to become too rigid.  6) Publicity We assigned Guillermo to redraft the timeline and the 'Take part in the consent process' graphic. Vani and Guillermo will both post them when the time comes.  7) New participant A new voice, Martin, joined in. He introduced himself as someone with a background in AI, neuroscience, and research into attention and consciousness. His questions about the ethics of training AI with books sparked a short discussion, and the group warmly welcomed him and pointed him toward the AI Ethics and R&D workgroups where those discussions would continue.",

        "narrative": "Not many people gave their opinions during the meeting.  At Guillermo's request, we added an extra section to the Miro board, to collect feedback about the Governance Dashboard specifically.  Key points raised:  1) Participation and quorum - Participation was good eventually, at 31% of core contributors (only just below all-time high of 33% from last Quarter), but we noted that people had to be chased, and participation initially was so low that the closing date had to be extended because only 6 WGs had met the quorum. - Some felt that the quorum was problematic ('quorum felt useless, pushing people just to get the numbers aligned with our own %') - Others felt it was still useful ('We have always had to chase people to participate anyway - at least the quorum ensures we do keep chasing till a reasonable number take part. Many people I DM'ed said they had otheriwse been unaware the consent round was happening' - and there was a suggestion: 'leave the 'chasing people to take part' to the Workgroups?'    2) 80/20% rule Everyone who commented raised concerns about the 80/20% rule (the idea that a WG's budget should not be blocked by one or two objections, so will pass if no more than 20% of those who take part are objecting to it.) Points raised included  - '80/20 rule might need revisiting, some objections felt reassonable but didnt impact bc it passed anyway' - 'Either bring back the 2nd round, or reconsider 80/20 rule - is 20% threshold too high?' - 'the 80/20 was not effective' - '80/20% rule feels like people used it to get away with a lot of irregularities in their budgets and reports' - 'lots of proposals were passed only because of 80/20% rule.'    3) Accountability and responses to objections Although some felt that actual reporting per se had improved compared to last quarter, concerns were raised about how accountable WGs are in the event that an objection is raised (some connected this with the 80/20% rule): - 'people were not accountable enough and didn't respond to objections enough - because of 80/20 rule?' - 'responses to objections couldve been more complete and more timely' - 'back and forth with WGs - most WGs were not fully accountable' However, another opinion said - 'Objections discussion (in Gov Calls) was a good one'  Some felt that the follow-up process will be important - how will we track whether WGs have implemented suggestions? - 'Off the actual followup of the lessons learned is where the magic happens, looking forward to that' but some felt that this accountability should come *before* budgets are awarded: - 'make people more accountable before they get their budget, and address objections'    4) The consent process overall Several people were unhappy with the current process: - 'I feel like over exhausted from reporting and promoposing (but working on that) the quarterly iterations are too quick for small amount of funds, almost all the funds go to write a report about writing a report xD' - 'It still takes a lot of time to read reports and budgets properly.' - 'I think we have explored this consent process method enough and we need to look another way to approve budget proposals.' - 'The process has now completely morphed into a vote, and 'consent decisionmaking' has been entirely abandoned, but without any discussion or agreement. This isn't great process imo.' - 'the problem is not the ideas, the rules, the tools, etc whatever methodologies we come up with but instead our behaviour and attitudes towards is so we need to sit down and actually question ourselves.'  Suggested solutions included: - Consider a whole different decison process - Appoint (and pay) a small group of 'objectors' to read everything thoroughly and identify objections, and everyone else can agree or not, and/or can raise additional objections if they want - Either officially discuss and decide to move to a majority vote process, or make the Dashboard into a Consent tool - 'need better metrics for how/why a proposal would pass'    5) The Dashboard Most people liked the Dashboard overall, and felt that for a first iteration, it had worked well. People found it easier to use than the old process, and particularly liked the idea of discussion and WGs responding to what was being said/asked, although it was recognised that this didn't happen enough in this round and could be promoted more.  Suggestions for changes were mostly minor: - 'disclose names of those who consent or abstain, not just objections' - 'more attention should be placed on User experience' - 'fiddly to get to proposals, if you press Back button it takes you to top of page rather than where you were'  - 'we need a search box (ctrl-F doesn't work on a phone)'  A more major objection - the design of the tool had moved us from consent decisionmaking to majority voting without any discussion or agreement ('In short, we've let the design of our tooling shape/dictate our governance process. It should be the other way round.') and said that 'this is not just about calling it a 'vote' - it's also about the whole structure and layout of the dashbaord's 'consent/object' section, which completely reinforces the idea that it's a vote.' The suggestion here was either to redesign the dashboard as a consent tool, or discuss and agree to move to majority voting as our decision method.   6) Ethics of the AI assistant One ethical issue was raised about the use of the AI Assistant in the Dashboard: 'Using an untrained and un- contextualised chatbot, and encouraging people to base their decisions on it, is ethically questionable imo -and also not very effective :-)'",

Following that, we began to exchange greetings in our dialects.   Agenda number two featured a recap of minutes from the last meeting held in 2024 (14th November), you can find the summary here: Meeting Summary - African Guild - 14 November 2024 Momentarily, we ticked off the action items from the last meeting.  Discussion item: The theme of the discussion was 2024 in review. We want to see what we have done so far and possible ways to improve our output as a guild.   - According to Ayo, he said that the guild lived up to expectations, and he highlighted some of the initiatives that contributed to the success of the guild as well.  - Duke also added that the AMAs were so amazing and the marketing initiatives did the guild better; those initiatives have helped the guild to reach more people, cross-guild collaboration as well as cross-ecosystem collaboration, too.   - Duke also sends a shoutout to all the African guild members for their relentless efforts and dedication toward helping the guild achieve great milestones.  - On the other hand, Lady Tempestt talked about the need for proper budget planning.   - Martinsoki suggested that the guild should increase the meeting documentation reward to $25. Members embraced the idea, however, Clement added that the token price won't permit the guild at the moment, and Sucre also added that there shouldn't be any changes made to the Q1 budget.  Q4 marketing initiatives: Duke applauded the Q4 marketing initiative team for their commitment and excellent work. He also said that the winners of the initiative should be selected as soon as possible so we can reward them after the budget has been distributed. Through screen sharing, Duke showcased an interesting African documentary draft; he added that the documentary would be used to tell our stories as an African guild.  AMA session: It is worth mentioning that the last AMA session conducted in 2024 was a blast. The session had over 50 participants: Duke expressed his appreciation to the team, and he added the rewards will be distributed as soon as the Q1 budget is released. In Q4 2024, we decided to create a unique or separate catalog for documenting or reporting the AMA sessions so it is easy to track its impact over time.   Budget: We skimmed over the Q1 budget to have a look at what we planned to do in this quarter. Pending rewards will be paid from the Q1 allocation, after which the focus group will meet to refit the budget so that we do not run out of budget again like before. Duke also added that there would be research and education initiatives in Q1 as opposed to previous quarters where we did only research (we want to tell and educate people about our stories as an African). As a matter of finality, Duke said that the guild might revert to a bi-weekly meeting schedule just so we don't max out the budget 'Experience is the best teacher.'",

Clement responded that it should be ceremonial, maybe once a month or every first meeting of the month someone can be assigned to lead it.  Action item from last meeting was looked into and followed up.  Q4 AMA report: Duke noted that we have the audio reports but still need a written format of the report, which Ayo replied that the written report is ready.  Q4 marketing initiation update: CJ Franklin updated that nomination of four individual has been made for there outstanding submissions and the announcement will be made on the discord channel which will lead to a vote to determine the first, second, third and fourth places. The vote will determine the winners   AMA session: This was held on 29th of November, which has at least 50 participant. They all came together to talk about the African landscape and how we are relating with AI and it was led by two amazing speakers Kosiso Udodi the founder of Colossai AI and Daniel Effiom the COO of Reno search. During the session there was icebreaker activities, speakers talk, interactive quizzes, closing remark and Q&A sessions. The main objective for the AMA was to have people express there concerns and questions regarding AI which was achieved. Questions were buzzing, interaction was great and feedback was awesome. We marketed this event on various social media platforms both individually and also in the SingularitNet ecosystem. Weaknesses: We had connectivity issues and also we expected wider reach not just Nigerians but other African nations which we didn't have. Key learning: From the session we learned about the roadblocks or the obstacles that Africans is having concerning adopting artificial intelligence solution as fast as the Western world or the European world are doing and it was noted to be just a thing of infrastructure and economical challenge which is largely associated with governmental policies and out of our control. But at the same time we spoke on the essence of having practical solution in healthcare, education and basic things that we are dealing with within Africa that's the Europeans and western world already has. Participants recommended that they should be better pre event communication, better details on events, better marketing strategy to reach more people, technical support for managing collectivity issues. We conclusion the event by speaking on our Future events.  Duke also added that for the future iteration of the AMA session, we should discuss more on SingularityNet focused conversations.   Partnership: During the holiday Hogantuso reached out to Chainbase led in African. Hogan stated that Chainbase is an AI project, and so he spoke with the led and they would love to be in a collaboration with SingularityNet. Duke also stated that this is a great opportunity and since we have no issue will cross ecosystem collaboration, we could leverage on to promote SingularityNet ecosystem and the ambassador program but there is some constraints we may have due to resources   Q1  2025 budget fitting:  The focus group met over the week to fit our budget. It was noted that we requested 5,220 USD and the budget was broken down and fitted into Q1 activities which amounted to the allocated budget but because of our outstanding payment  from Q4, we are left with 3,450 USD and because of this we have had to cut down so many things including our weekly meetings, we would have to revert to bi weekly meetings to reduce cost.  Ubuntu and AI II: This phase two of the Ubuntu and AI project is mostly going to focus on consolidation and community building. We are looking at expanding our reach by hosting the Ubuntu and AI conversations in Egypt, South Africa, Rwanda and Ghana.  Duke stated that the goal is to deepen our engagement within African communities, promote Ubuntu philosophy and AI ethics  and formalizing more partnerships and secure core funding. This is a year long project, during of 12 months from January 2025 to December 2025.   Duke discussed the SingularityNet Africa community's online platforms and a referral contest aimed at boosting engagement which top three will be rewarded. He highlighted the community's current membership is 257. Duke also outlined marketing and education initiatives for this quarter which will including partnerships beyond the Singularity ecosystem. Which may lead to funding members attendance at AI and blockchain events across Africa.",

        "narrative": "Introduction: The meeting began with a discussion led by Duke about the quorum required for the weekly meetings. He raised the question of what should be the minimum number of attendees needed to constitute a valid meeting, given that their average attendance is around 14-15 people, but they've had meetings with as few as 3-4 people. We debated whether decisions made by a smaller quorum should be considered binding, even if the majority of members were absent.  Ese suggested that the quorum could be set at a minimum of 6 members, with the understanding that the gravity of the agenda items should also be considered. Ayo felt that monthly meetings would not work if the goal is to build a true community, and that bi-weekly meetings are more appropriate. We agreed to keep the meeting time the same, despite some suggestions to change it.  The discussion then moved to marketing initiatives. Ese reported they are still in the ideation phase, and need to have final brainstorming sessions to select a campaign focused on engaging the wider African community. Duke suggested it would be helpful to plan marketing initiatives further in advance, aligning them with the overall Singularity Net narrative and topics like Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).  Kossiso provided an update on Colossal AI's efforts to democratize access to AI in Africa. They are planning a series of training programs in February to teach people how to integrate AI into their workflows, as well as how to deploy large language models locally. This will be followed by a policy discussion event in March, and the launch of their own AI model, Imara, built on the DeepSeek foundation.  Clement discussed an upcoming 'Afro-AI Multilingual Literacy Drive' initiative, which will focus on creating community-centered educational materials to demystify AI and showcase its practical applications in areas like agriculture, education, health, and fintech. The content will feature African innovators and use storytelling approaches to inspire local participation.",

Q4 marketing initiatives: From the marketing side of things, CjFrankie shared an update on the Q1 marketing initiative; he stated that the team is still brainstorming around what the best strategy would be for the guild in Q1.   Education & translation initiative: This groundbreaking initiative is spearheaded by Sucre and Clement, whose vision is to create a communication-centered initiative focused on AI/ASI in the African context. We had a presentation from Clement, which included a clear explanation of the project. Still in its infancy, Clement added that Africa lags in communications around AI, and the goal of the project is to bridge the gaps using a multilingual educational approach to create and translate artificial intelligence materials in three African languages. More so, some of the major objectives of this project are to diversify AI, ASI, and the SingularityNET ecosystem at large. Develop a library of multilingual AI content that can be used for continuous learning and engagement and create a learning platform for mass adoption.   The idea of creating a learning platform piqued Duke's interest, which led to him asking further questions for clarity's sake: Clement clears the air by saying that the 'learning platform' will be like a knowledge repository where people go for continuous knowledge sharing and learning, and the team may consider using a YouTube channel, while Duke suggested that Udemy will be a good platform to explore. This conversation switched gears as Duke talked about the importance of partnership in any project. At a glance, the initiative looks promising already, and there's a need to partner with some other WGs like the marketing guild, video, or writers WG to help us better amplify and publicize any future initiatives.   Partnership: Duke hinted that phase two of Ubuntu and AI is already in progress; he added that phase one of Ubuntu and AI didn't get the attention we needed, and as a result, the African guild should strengthen their ties with other workgroups to achieve great results. The meeting also included discussions about Clement and Advance Emmanuel, who recently received funding to travel to Ethiopia to spread awareness about SingularityNET and onboard new members through interviews and surveys. Congratulations to both Clement and Advance-cheers to a successful year ahead!",

Update on Advance and Clement's proposal: During the last meeting, the success of the proposal was highlighted. They are expected to depart very soon, in order to arrive in Ethiopia ahead of the day. At the Ethiopia event they will serve as point men to help expand SingularityNET African community.  Marketing initiatives: Ese gave an overview of the initiative, she highlighted that it is going to be in three phase.  Phase one, learning phase. This is when we gathering all the learning resources that have been created, create Africanized videos and post it on our social media and after every video there will be a short quiz to help foster engagement in our community. Phase two,  teaching phase. This is when we partner with communities hubs across different regions and host a series of workshops with them. Phase three, this is when we create journalistic content and share it across various channels in Africa.  Duke expressed his appreciation but encourage them to speed up the initiative.   Education and translation initiatives: Clement noted that we are currently creating materials and hopefully before the end of the month we should have the materials in English. He aslo said it not going to be a formal session, it is going to be like a movie session very interactive.  Clement noted that the story we would tell will be a blend of ASI SingularityNET, AI and technology and Africa. Our aim is to educate people about the ecosystem, AI, technology but all within the African context.  Members collective: Duke raised the idea to bring back the members collective. Where members were encouraged to shared their thoughts and have it funded in other to advance the guild. Duke thought of bringing back this initiative for Q2.",

        "narrative": "Intro: The weekly meeting of the African guild kicked off at 5:07 pm with a welcoming greeting from Duke. Before we began the meeting proper, Duke asked everyone how they've been and what they've been up to lately. Some members spoke about a few things they've been working on. We also looked at the summary note from the last meeting, and everything looks good. However, Duke encourages documenters to always submit their summary promptly; he also emphasized the need for a standard font across all documentation.   Q1 Marketing Initiatives: Ese Williams shared an update on the progress of the Q1 marketing initiative spearheaded by Ayo, Lady Tempestt, CJ, and her humble self. She hinted that the content outline/script for the first video was ready! She added that the shooting will commence soon. She also talked about shooting the video at Badagry (because it has African heritage and culture). 'Once the video is shot and edited, it will be published on all the social media platforms, Ese.' Duke encouraged the team to hasten their work because Q1 is almost drawing to a close.  Updates on the Ethiopian Trip: Clement shares his experience and thoughts about his trip to Ethiopia 🇪🇹 with Advance Amayaw, 'It was quite interesting and unique. The event was held in Addis Ababa, where they interacted with individuals from other ecosystems, developers, and community managers. We also established partnerships, which will impact the African guild-Clement.' He also added that they engaged with African developers and some AI enthusiasts (students), and they spread the word about Deep Funding. Clement also said that it wasn't easy for him and Advance to adapt to the Ethiopian dishes.   Education and Translation Initiative: Clement gave a heads-up about these initiatives, hinting that the team is progressing towards making the series for the video content, and as a result, a video editor is needed. Thankfully, Eae showed interest in making the video! He spoke about how the initiative is poised to educate people about AI. For example, how AI can help farmers talk to the sky. Clement also mentioned that the video series will be hosted on GitHub for anyone to access. A few weeks ago, we talked about how we could set up a website and also host the series on learning platforms like Udemy. However, the token price has made us put a hold on that.   Content Calendar: Advance Amayaw showcased a document in the meeting that highlights the collaborative efforts of all workgroups in the Ambassador Program. Its primary purpose is to coordinate social media content ideas, schedules, and updates. The goal is to ensure that all workgroups follow brand guidelines when creating content (graphics, videos, etc.) and to provide feedback and approvals on drafted posts to maintain quality and brand alignment.  Budget: As Q1 2025 draws to a close, the drafting of the Q2 budget has begun. Duke mentioned that the African Guild is reviving the Members Collective-an initiative that allows guild members to propose ideas for bootstrapping marketing efforts and expanding SNET's reach across borders. The meeting concluded with Duke encouraging members to submit their proposals in hopes of securing funding to get the job done.  Highlights/Upcoming Events: Be on the lookout for phase 2 of the Ubuntu and AI series, as well as the marketing and translation initiatives and hackathon. As a matter of finality, the new people introduced themselves to the house; Alfred thanked the Duke for the warm welcome.",

We are not chasing them   Summary quality remains problematic, and we note that despite our 'experiment' with unaudited summaries, it will probably be difficult to trace / identify the source of a problem if we notice that our knowledge graph is returning information that is inaccurate because of inadequte summaries.  Core problem is vague summaries that waffle on with pointless, adjective-heavy  'story-like' detail, but fail to capture actual decisions (e.g. 'A hugelky important and transformative decision was made about XYZ' without specifying what the decision was). This could perhaps be addressed in the summary tool redesign next year - removing 'narrative' field and asking only for decisions, aqnd generally, much less unstructured data/free text?  We raised the possibility of closing the corpus rather than filling it with poor-quality material. We have not reached this stage yet, but it is a possibility.",

We noted that other measures might need to be implemented eventually (e.g proper training for documenters? Pushing the idea that it is unethical to use AI-generated material without having some oversight of it?)",
            "rationale": "The poor quality is largely caused by documenters relying uncritically on unmediated AI-generated content, which is usually vague and unspecific because AI summary tools don't know our context; and documenters not applying sufficient 'human-in-the-loop' critical insight to correct and expand AI summaries. As we do not have budget for quality control, and documenters do not seem to mind the ethical problems with uncritical use of AI-generated material, perhaps closing the corpus would be abetter approach than having an Archives full of nonsense."

(e.g. if someone is present but not participating) - but do co-attendance and degree give more subtle data on this?

(tracking the spread of an idea across WGs, and how open to input the originators are)  - VOLUNTARY vs PAID WORK: (of course, requires ways of tracking volunteer work - Governance WG has been discussing this, e.g. logging it in a spreadsheet and then via Dework - see sample log here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MD6V9PbW-h7OwqEj3kdVgf27RaQfr4G6v4gH67Ya2io/edit?usp=sharing; logging who speaks in a meeting, audio or in Chat; weekly nominations process for who has contributed something you found useful that week; etc)  DECISIONS: how WGs and people are connected to decisions and decision-making. Who's contributing, whose thinking is being heard, are different WGs making decisions on similar topics and are they influenced by each other, etc  TAGS: looking at where similar topic tags are seen across different WGs  MEETING OUTCOMES: How do we track what comes out of meetings?

        "narrative": "The first of 2 sessions about holding WGs accountable beyond just the budget consent process.  WORK QUALITY We noted that despite having discussed work quality several times, we still have not established an *ongoing* process for  a) assessing it and b) dealing with perceieved problems with it.  We do have the ad-hoc approach of running sentiment surveys to gather opinions about it; but as yet, the only action that has been taken on the basis of these is to adjust budget caps, which does not really address work quality.  We noted that there probably needs to be a public, Program-wide discussion on what is meant by 'good / bad quality work'. On this,  - 1) we had some discussion on whether or not it is even quantifiable; - 2) we agreed that it should be evidence-based as far as possible (i.e. we should ask people to back their opinions up with evidence) - 3) perhaps requiring or recommending a Theory of Change from each WG would help them to define for themselves what 'good quality work' means for them, and then the Program counld hold them accountable to that?  - 4) Maybe this ('what is good-quality work?') would be a good Town Hall topic. - 5) Whereas in the past there was a broad agreement that 'work quality' discussions should be decoupled from budget decisions, the feeling of this meeting was that this is no longer the case, and that if a WG is producing bad quality work, it **should** affect their budget.   ACCOUNTABILITY In the rolling agenda doc, there has been a suggestion of having a range of of possible processes to hold WGs accountable - e.g.  - using sentiment analysis to decide if a WG should be stopped; - probationary periods, and/or a process for giving a WG a warning and a time period in which to fix a particular expectation that needs to be met or it ceases to exist next quarter - possible overall restructure of the whole Program to address issues raised  We agreed that the measures taken would need to be decided on a WG-by-WG basis, tailored to the specific issues that have been identified for that WG. We discussed how this could be done, and concluded that using one of the WGs' own meetings for the discussion would wrk best, rather then trying to cover each WG in Givernance meetings in Q1 2026.  We agreed it would probably be unfair to end a WG on the basis of a sentiment survey alone, and that input from past consent processes should also be used  We suggested there could be a set of ground rules for minimum expectations for WGs, and any underperforming WGs should be given a chance to improve before being stopped.   SENTIMENT SURVEY v.3 Most of those in the meeting felt that we should implement a new sentiment survey this Quarter, but in a more focused way, looking at work quality, transparency, and perhaps impact / outcomes, as these have been raised several times in past GovWG sessions and in the budget consent process as important.  We'll use GoogleForms, because of the analytics it offers - and it will be anonymous.  We also want to include space for people to give rationales for their views, because in the last survey (which did not ask for reasons), the responses were sometimes puzzling  Timeline for this:  - Lola will draft the survey; it will be sent out early Nov with a closing date of 17th Nov - We will analyse results by the end of this Quarter - Then early next Quarter (Q1 2026), we'll sit down with WGs who have had 'poor sentiment' and talk thru what changes are being suggested - we'll also use past objections in the consent process as part of this - And we will, by then, have in place a range of possible measures / actions that can be implemented, but we'll work it out with each WG on a case-by-case basis - The WGs will be asked to implement whatever is agreed during the rest of Q1 2026, and reflect it in their reporting and budgeting for Q2 2026.   FOR OUR NEXT MEETING, ON TUES 21ST OCT: - 1) we need to discuss what these 'measures and actions' could be - 2) we need someone to draft a bit of text explaining the sentiment survey and how it is going to be used - 3) Sign off Lola's survey draft - 4) decide who's distributing it, and think a bit about how to best publicise it",

        "narrative": "This was a discursive meeting, introducing some new ideas, and wasn't aiming at making decisions at this stage.  KEY QUESTIONS: - Should rewards be based more on impact and outcomes, rather than (as at present) on budget requests in advance, and KPIs?  - What changes would be required, and how might it affect funding and accountability? - How should we measure impact?   BUDGET APPROVAL IN RETROSPECT? This idea originated from discussions in a long Gov WG meeting last year, where it was suggested that rather than putting forward a budget plan for the coming Quarter, and getting consent in advance for things that might not happen (e.g. due to changes in token price), it might be better if WGs made spending decisions ad-hoc, and then reported at the end of the Quarter on what that had done, and if the community's consent for them to continue was given in retrospect on the basis of how they had managed their budgets. So WGs make no specific promises on what they will spend money on, other than that they will spend it wisely; and during the Quarter they can be responsive to changing conditions; and at the end, they are assessed on their results, not their promises So although there would be a danger of a WG mismanaging funds for one Quarter, after that they would no longer get the community's consent to continue.  This becomes easier now that we have implemented budget caps, so a WG cannot go above a pre-agreed amount.    And incorporating more recent discussions in GovWG about impact and outcomes - should we be asking WGs to report on the impact of their work, rather than outputs and KPIs, and is that what we should be asking the community to assess them on? So not so much 'was it done?' but 'was it a good idea?'    HOW TO MEASURE IMPACT? Should we use a WG's past performance / track record as a guide to assessing its impact? Perhaps not, because even a group with no track record could still have impact.  Should we take the radical approach of putting *all* WGs on 'probation' next Quarter, and they must prove their impact in order to continue? Could be a bit too harsh - but addresses the issue that at present, if no impact is made, nothing happens and it's not a problem. But overall, people felt the 'everyone is on probation' approach would be unfair, since some WGs *have* been producing impact.  Each WG could create a simplified / minimal Theory of Change to make intended impact cleearer - they could point to what has happened to move them towards their intended change?  Or a Social Value / Social Return on Investment approach?  Problem with measuring impact is that it requires gathering data, often qualitative data - which is expensive work that WGs rarely budget for.    IMPACT, EXPERIMENTATION, RISK, AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM? Guillermo: if some WGs are not bringing outcomes, it raises concerns about the sustainability of the Program. Fairness - we should not treat all workgroups the same when they have different track records. Acccountability is important - but we shouldn't be too ready to experiment or change the whole process when token price is so low.  The alternative view was that low token price is the time to experiment with our processes, as we have little to lose in financial terms.  Should we be more cautious and less experimental when token price is low? And would an 'impact-based' approach mean more experimentation and risk taking, or less? If a WG tried a new idea and it failed and had no impact (even if they did other work that did have impact), would that failure mean they risk losing their funding in the following Quarter if the rest of the community disapproved? OR is the focus more on a 'consent process' idea of 'has it caused harm?' i.e. even if one part of a EWG;s work fails, the community would still consent if they felt that continuing to give them a budget was sufficiently safe and they were not going to keep wasting money?    REPORTING GUIDELINES, CONSENT, AND THE DANGERS OF A MAJORITY VOTe Advance planning can helps maintain focus and accountability However at times of falling token price, the need for constant 'budget fitting' is a lot of overhead. It might be better to leave WGs free to decide on spending ad-hoc, in response to conditions, rather than having to conform to an advance plan that might not be sustainable. Planning would of course still be done, but it would be more internal.  Perhaps a WG's Theory of Change would become its 'plan'? Keep the focus on what the impact needs to be, and respond to changing conditions to determine the best way to achieve it?  Alfred: We need clearer reporting guidelines. And - will the decision on how well a WG spent its money be a consent process, or will it morph into a majority vote? Will it give WGs too much freedom to do things without having to seek approval first? Without proper guidelines, the process couldturn into a popularity contest; and WGs with large memberships could secure majority approval even if they are not showing much impact.   IMPLEMENTING CHANGES? We noted that not all WGs are represented in Governance meetings, so they cannot be decision-making in and of themselves. But we also noted that meetings are open and people could attend if they chose - and also, any decision we suggest will be posted in the Decision-To-Be-Made Discord channel, and given a week for objections to be raised  FINAL THOUGHTS We agreed to a) reflect further on the idea of not submitting budgets in advance, and b) try to come up with other ideas for how to connect rewards with real impact. We will discuss further next meeting - the planned topic is ideas for changes to the consent process, so it's part of the same overall subject.",

        "narrative": "1) WG budget adjustments due to low token price  No payments have been made yet this Quarter due to falling token prace. We previously did a 'budget-fitting' in which we agreed to reduce payments for documentation from $20 to %15, but token price is now so low that even this is unaffordable.  We also need to clarify whether we will pay facilitators - currently we cannot afford to do so in USD, even if we (as previously agreed) do take the 1,500 AGIX that was left unallocated when we worked out the Q4 budget caps.  If we switch to pricing tasks in AGIX, however, we could pay both roles - payments would work out at around 80 AGIX per task. Till now, we have been reluctatnt to pass on the problem of token price instability to the individual - but with prices so low, there might be no alternative.  Vani will look at the budget, work out exactly where we stand, and suggest an approach and post in the GovWG channel so people can agree or disagree   2) Documentation inaccuracy  Currently documentation of GovWG meetings is quite poor, with decisions often not being accurately captured. A lot of correction is needed, and Vani no longer has time to do it. Perhaps the low standards are due to low pay? Suggestion - we will try having a live, collaborative doc during the meeting itself, where everyone can take part in keeping notes; then the documenter only needs to add it to the summary tool. Or we could keep notes in the Zoom Chat.    3) Reporting template for Q4 2025 quarterly reports  We have agreed that there will be no budget consent process this Quarter, and only minimal reporting. Vani drafted a template for minimal Q4 reports that can be added to the Governance Dashboard, and Guillermo has said this probably can be added to the Dashboard in time for the end of the Quarter. But Tevo and Alfred have done considerable work on how they want to report for Treasury Guild and Treasury Automation, using a template that gives more detailed info. We agreed that this template shouldn't be used for all WGs, as it's a bit too detailed and would remove the advantage of minimising the reporting overhead for WGs; but we agreed there needs to be an option for Treasury WGs to add their full reports as a doc. We also agreed to ask WGs to list work that they planned but *didn't* do this Quarter - this will almost certainly be due to low token price, and will help quantify how much work is hindered by token price fluctuations.    4) Finalise sentiment survey design  Based on feedback in last meeting and async, Vani has revised the draft. Instead of a list of tick-boxes, we now have a section for each WG, and space for people to optionally give rationales for their opinions. We recognise this will make the survey quite long, but it is optional.  We agreed the survey will be anonymous - we will ask for Discord names, to ensure that respondents are indeed Core Contributors, but this will only be visible to one person (probably Peter, or whoever's accoiunt the survey is shared on) and will be redacted before results are shared.  We agreed to include only the questions on  - work quality - impact - transparency as we felt these were the priority issues that we wanted to know about.  We refined the rating scale for 'impact' to 'Large positive; small positive; no impact; negative impact'.  We also agreed to include both 'I don't know this WG's work' and 'I prefer not to give an opinion' for all 3 questions.   5) Sentiment survey distribution We agreed on posting in Ambassador-General and Decision-To-Be-Made Discord channels for the first week; and then in the 2nd week, Peter and Vani will DM Core Contributors who haven't yet responded    The survey will go out tomorrow, 5th Nov, and close on Mon 17th. Results will be discussed in GovWG on 20th, 25th and 27th Nov, after Tevo's analysis.",

        "narrative": "TOPIC: What is 'work', and how do we recognise and value the invisible work we all do  1) What does this community value as 'work'?  What do we / don't we count, and why?  - participating in governance, monthly WG updates, Town Hall, etc are invisible work - R&D decided to reward otherwise invisible work on Gov-Dash - the off-record discussions and async chats. A lot of this kind of work we don't even track the time. Tevo did similar in Treasury - 'Emotional Housework' is pretty much always invisible - Support for new members and mentoring to tasks - Small micro-efforts - reminding people about stuff, posting reminders, that makes stuff work. Too small to put on Dework - Attending WG calls could be work right - but is attendance the same as participation? Participation over presence - Filing out surveys or consent forms - Things that people pay out of their own pockets - tooling etc (and paying tourist dollar rate on credit card!) Need to update lists of what paid accounts the program has and what individuals are paying for.    2) What's paid, and what's voluntary? How do we decide?  - We prioritise tech tasks over admin, emotional, community - perhaps we shouldn't - Lots of WGs are doing operations with no rewards - keep outcomes and scope, but rewards have dropped 70% of our work became invisible... LatAm; Onboarding; Archives; all have done this But tracking it still, so can reward it if price goes back up - Should we pay everything? Does it change the nature of it (e.g. giving someone emotional support)  if it becomes a transaction?    3) How do we count and record the voluntary bits?  - Vani shared demo 'invisible work' log - could everyine do this? - Important to keep overheads minimal - if it takes more effort to log than to do, it's not good. So keep it as rough estimates - we do need to know WHAT it was - It's all equivalent - For now, no need to check - it's an honour system (or maybe check very clear outliers but that's it). But maybe it becomes an issue if it feeds into a reputation system  - We also shared Draft 'invisible work hero' nomination form https://forms.gle/aujqzYv4SpkisPEt5   - It's not competitive - anyone who is nominated gets added to Dework and gets task points. - People liked this idea.  - Maybe nomination could eventually lead to a bonus?? - Are there ways we can reward work other than money/tokens?

        "narrative": "PRESENTATIONS There were short presentations from 4 Ambassador Program workgroups, focusing on the issues raised for decentralised communities when they use AI tooling in their governance systems.  1. Ethical AI use in community governance (Stephen Whitenstall, SingularityNET Archives) When we use AI tooling in our governance, e.g. to help us interpret our records, its outputs must be auditable. Good recordkeeping is obviously important for governance transparency; and knowledge graphs and other AI processes can help us interpret records, and track changes in our governance processes. But for good ethics, we need community verification of such AI-generated insights - so we should build in processes for a community to audit and verify what AI says about governance. Prompting our AI tools, and engineering the context, are important, but community verification of AI outputs is perhaps even more so. It is the community who determine what records 'mean'.   2. Community-first intelligence and African pathways to ethical and inclusive AI: Duke Peter (sNET Ambassador Program African Guild) AI connects us digitally but can isolate us socially - automated, contactless interactions can erode community. Western AI ethics frameworks tend to emphasise individual rights over collective wellbeing. By contrast, African Ubuntu philosophy ('I am because we are') redefines the 'intelligence' of 'artificial intelligence' as shared values and cooperation. African Guild's community reflection sessions have explored what 'trustworthy AI' would mean for different cultures and professions, leading to conference papers, research reports, educational materials, and Medium articles. The goal is to ensure that AI systems connect with the values of diverse local communities. By creating ethical frameworks that fit a range of cultural contexts, AI governance becomes more inclusive, and rooted in the full range of human values.    3. EthosGuard - an AI ethics & governance advisor agent (LordKizzy, AI Sandbox/ Think-Tank) EthosGuard is a proposed AI agent for ethical governance, designed for the SingularityNET Ambassador Program but applicable to any decentralised community. It supports fair and transparent decision-making, by helping people a) understand their community's governance structures and b) analyse governance issues according to their community's agreed values (e.g. decentralization, inclusion, etc).  Context engineering is important - EthosGuard  will be trained on the community's governance documents and records, and on general DAO ethics. It also uses participatory feedback loops and transparent reasoning, so that every recommendation cites the exact ethical principle involved. This addresses risks such as bias, automation creep, and ethical opacity.   4. Governance Framework (Guillermo Lucero Funes, R&D Guild)  The Governance Dashboard is a new tool, built on the ASI tech stack. to support the Ambassador Program's consent-based decisionmaking. It integrates an AI assistant intended as an augmentation layer, helping community members synthesize data and clarify arguments. Its first use, for the budget decision for Q4 2025, was done without any contextualising, due to . short deadlines and low development budget - but the next iteration will use the community's archives, decision records, and governance documents to provide context-aware guidance. As with other Ambassador Program tooling, context engineering is vital, and the itention is to engage the whole community with deciding exactly what material to use as context.   DISCUSSION  The different workgroups each have their own take, so the work is not monolithic and we can contrast the different approaches; but all recognise the need for human control over the technology, and the need for some kind of context engineering.  Data-first or context-first or values-first are complementay approaches that inform each other: the prompt-orientated approach takes community-specific data as context to say what our values actually are and prompt the AI to align with that; and the archival approach (more grounded-theory style?) examines the data for patterns to attempt to discover what the significant issues are, before designing prompts (e.g. if a particular topic keeps appearing in our meeting summaries, that suggests it is a significant issue in our community, and it could then become a prompt.)  Prompts are dynamic workflow of information, and can change in response to changes in the community. What is really interesting is tracking those bias shifts in a community - how a community evolves and responds to circumstances?  Use of blockchain may be a next step, for tracking and for immutability, and for auditability: if you create a prompt, e.g. a specific question, the prompt itself becomes a data object, and can be audited - it's not passive, it has its own context, so you have an audit trail for it, which is especially useful  if the prompt produces some unexpected results. (Compare Patrick Tobler of NMKR's recent work in Cardano on a platform that provides AI agents that are auditable on the blockchain.)  The different paradigms and values of different kinds of communities presents an interesting cha;llenge - can we create a community AI that is flexible enough to accommodate different types of community? We want to include dialogue in our governance - it's not only about what an AI can see from our written contexts, but also using our dialogues and discussions as a dataset - a way to really include the human element, by using the ways we engage and interact as a community as part of our contextual info. Discourse analysis?  Cultural difference - there are differences WITHIN a culture as well as between different cultures. Dissent within a culture creates richness, and can be undermined by monolithic systems or forced conformity - but how do we pronmpt AI to take account of internal dissent?  Could we create an AI model that is geographically aware, and interacts wih people in, say, Africa differenly from how it interacts with people in Europe or Latin America, respecting their cultural contexts? Because we can't (and don't want to) bting everyone under a universal umbrella.  RE meta-governance and communities auditing their own biases - bias is inevitable, and is not a bad thing in itself - e.g, a community could be biased in favour of inclusivity, or open-source. 'Bias' can be another word for 'values'. And change is inevitable too, your governance processes and biases may change.These self-audit processes are all quite internal to a community. So how do we build adaptable/generic tools, that other communities can also use - even communities that are not Web3 based?  In Cardano some years back, we hoped to be able to 'plug in' any culture on top of the layer 1 blockchain governance. but cultural assumptions ended up being made   - e.g the US-style idea of a constitution. Now, we have similar with AI communities - systems being designed not as a neutral base with 'add-ons' for particular cultural contexrts, but wih cultural assumptions on the base level.  Using tools in a way that fits our context is not just geographic - there's  intersectionality with other forms of difference (sex, gender, sexuality, disability, age, rural/urban-ness etc). So what we are building is not so much the tool itself, as the processes for different kinds of communities to manage contextualisation, and the ways for a community or a person to see themselves reflected in the tool. Anyone can build a tool; but building blueprints or toolkits forthe  community contextualising processes is harder.  Not knowing your history often undermines community - in an AI tooling context, that would mean not having control of what the questions are and what the contextual info is How do we ensure WE are the ones who get to say 'This is what our community means'?",

They highlighted the importance of cognitive capacities and ethical considerations in defining the AI's personality. The conversation also touched on the necessity of organizing ideas and prioritizing tasks to build a comprehensive framework for AI assistance.",
          "Data Integration and AI Assistant Development Tevo Kask and Guillermo focused on the integration of data sources into a machine-readable format for the AI assistant. They highlighted the need for contextual training to ensure the AI can effectively assist with governance decisions within the Ambassador Program. Esther Galfalvi raised questions about the expected interactions with the AI assistant, while Vani pointed out the necessity of including relevant historical context to improve decision-making. Guillermo highlighted their significant usage of the AI assistant, with nearly a thousand interactions recorded since its launch. Vani questioned the method of counting these interactions, seeking clarity on whether they referred to individual chats or posts. The discussion also touched on the importance of having a disclaimer for deeper analysis of the AI assistant's conversations.",
          "Data Privacy and Ethics Discussion Esther and Vani engaged in a discussion about the implications of data privacy and consent in their community. Vani argued that the focus should be on data privacy rather than AI ethics, expressing concerns about the potential for misuse of data. Guillermo recognized the importance of establishing a clear consent process and the need for transparency regarding data usage, while also noting the difficulties in managing individual consent in a small community. Guillermo highlighted the benefits of increased transparency in their reporting processes, noting that visibility encourages better attention to detail and accountability. Vani questioned the distinction between past and current reporting practices, suggesting that visibility has always existed. Esther proposed that the formalization of reports might enhance their perceived immutability."

        "narrative": "PRESENTATIONS There were short presentations from 4 Ambassador Program workgroups, focusing on the issues raised for decentralised communities when they use AI tooling in their governance systems.  1. Ethical AI use in community governance (Stephen Whitenstall, SingularityNET Archives) When we use AI tooling in our governance, e.g. to help us interpret our records, its outputs must be auditable. Good recordkeeping is obviously important for governance transparency; and knowledge graphs and other AI processes can help us interpret records, and track changes in our governance processes. But for good ethics, we need community verification of such AI-generated insights - so we should build in processes for a community to audit and verify what AI says about governance. Prompting our AI tools, and engineering the context, are important, but community verification of AI outputs is perhaps even more so. It is the community who determine what records 'mean'.   2. Community-first intelligence and African pathways to ethical and inclusive AI: Duke Peter (sNET Ambassador Program African Guild) AI connects us digitally but can isolate us socially - automated, contactless interactions can erode community. Western AI ethics frameworks tend to emphasise individual rights over collective wellbeing. By contrast, African Ubuntu philosophy ('I am because we are') redefines the 'intelligence' of 'artificial intelligence' as shared values and cooperation. African Guild's community reflection sessions have explored what 'trustworthy AI' would mean for different cultures and professions, leading to conference papers, research reports, educational materials, and Medium articles. The goal is to ensure that AI systems connect with the values of diverse local communities. By creating ethical frameworks that fit a range of cultural contexts, AI governance becomes more inclusive, and rooted in the full range of human values.    3. EthosGuard - an AI ethics & governance advisor agent (LordKizzy, AI Sandbox/ Think-Tank) EthosGuard is a proposed AI agent for ethical governance, designed for the SingularityNET Ambassador Program but applicable to any decentralised community. It supports fair and transparent decision-making, by helping people a) understand their community's governance structures and b) analyse governance issues according to their community's agreed values (e.g. decentralization, inclusion, etc).  Context engineering is important - EthosGuard  will be trained on the community's governance documents and records, and on general DAO ethics. It also uses participatory feedback loops and transparent reasoning, so that every recommendation cites the exact ethical principle involved. This addresses risks such as bias, automation creep, and ethical opacity.   4. Governance Framework (Guillermo Lucero Funes, R&D Guild)  The Governance Dashboard https://singularitynet-governance-dashboard.vercel.app/dashboard is a new tool, built on the ASI tech stack. to support the Ambassador Program's consent-based decisionmaking. It integrates an AI assistant intended as an augmentation layer, helping community members synthesize data and clarify arguments. Its first use, for the budget decision for Q4 2025, was done without any contextualising, due to . short deadlines and low development budget - but the next iteration will use the community's archives, decision records, and governance documents to provide context-aware guidance. As with other Ambassador Program tooling, context engineering is vital, and the itention is to engage the whole community with deciding exactly what material to use as context.   DISCUSSION  The different workgroups each have their own take, so the work is not monolithic and we can contrast the different approaches; but all recognise the need for human control over the technology, and the need for some kind of context engineering. . Data-first or context-first or values-first are complementay approaches that inform each other: the prompt-orientated approach takes community-specific data as context to say what our values actually are and prompt the AI to align with that; and the archival approach (more grounded-theory style?) examines the data for patterns to attempt to discover what the significant issues are, before designing prompts (e.g. if a particular topic keeps appearing in our meeting summaries, that suggests it is a significant issue in our community, and it could then become a prompt.) . Prompts are dynamic workflow of information, and can change in response to changes in the community. What is really interesting is tracking those bias shifts in a community - how a community evolves and responds to circumstances? . Use of blockchain may be a next step, for tracking and for immutability, and for auditability: if you create a prompt, e.g. a specific question, the prompt itself becomes a data object, and can be audited - it's not passive, it has its own context, so you have an audit trail for it, which is especially useful  if the prompt produces some unexpected results. (Compare Patrick Tobler of NMKR's recent work in Cardano on a platform that provides AI agents that are auditable on the blockchain.) . The different paradigms and values of different kinds of communities presents an interesting cha;llenge - can we create a community AI that is flexible enough to accommodate different types of community? We want to include dialogue in our governance - it's not only about what an AI can see from our written contexts, but also using our dialogues and discussions as a dataset - a way to really include the human element, by using the ways we engage and interact as a community as part of our contextual info. Discourse analysis? . Cultural difference - there are differences WITHIN a culture as well as between different cultures. Dissent within a culture creates richness, and can be undermined by monolithic systems or forced conformity - but how do we pronmpt AI to take account of internal dissent? . Could we create an AI model that is geographically aware, and interacts wih people in, say, Africa differenly from how it interacts with people in Europe or Latin America, respecting their cultural contexts? Because we can't (and don't want to) bting everyone under a universal umbrella. . RE meta-governance and communities auditing their own biases - bias is inevitable, and is not a bad thing in itself - e.g, a community could be biased in favour of inclusivity, or open-source. 'Bias' can be another word for 'values'. And change is inevitable too, your governance processes and biases may change.These self-audit processes are all quite internal to a community. So how do we build adaptable/generic tools, that other communities can also use - even communities that are not Web3 based? . In Cardano some years back, we hoped to be able to 'plug in' any culture on top of the layer 1 blockchain governance. but cultural assumptions ended up being made   - e.g the US-style idea of a constitution. Now, we have similar with AI communities - systems being designed not as a neutral base with 'add-ons' for particular cultural contexrts, but wih cultural assumptions on the base level. . Using tools in a way that fits our context is not just geographic - there's  intersectionality with other forms of difference (sex, gender, sexuality, disability, age, rural/urban-ness etc). So what we are building is not so much the tool itself, as the processes for different kinds of communities to manage contextualisation, and the ways for a community or a person to see themselves reflected in the tool. Anyone can build a tool; but building blueprints or toolkits forthe  community contextualising processes is harder. . Not knowing your history often undermines community - in an AI tooling context, that would mean not having control of what the questions are and what the contextual info is How do we ensure WE are the ones who get to say 'This is what our community means'?",

He also highlighted the establishment of a temporary workgroup for Q4 fundraising efforts, addressing challenges in member selection due to high interest. Guillermo Lucero followed with an update on hackathon participation, stressing the need for better communication and collaboration to enhance agent development.  Abdulbasit introduced DeepFeed, a social platform designed for internal communication among AI innovators, aimed at improving collaboration within the decentralized AI community. He detailed the platform's features, including user login with existing credentials, posting updates, and managing visibility of contributions. The initiative seeks to involve Singularity Net Ambassadors as early adopters to gather feedback and ensure effective communication. The discussion also covered the ongoing development of features to amplify the decentralized AI ecosystem, with an emphasis on community involvement and marketing strategies to promote the platform.  The meeting included a discussion on recruiting Singularity Net ambassadors, with Abdulbasit proposing a target of 50, which Peter suggested might be ambitious given the current number of core contributors. The group agreed on using Discord for outreach, as it would be more effective than email. Abdulbasit confirmed that the platform would allow all users to post content related to AI, Web3, and blockchain, and he mentioned plans for a feedback mechanism to enhance user engagement. Peter concluded by proposing a weekly session for BGI 25 planning this Friday 13UTC and reminded workgroup leads to submit budget proposals and quarterly reports by the next day.",

Workgroups will only need to submit a brief report on Q4 activities by early December; a template for this will be in the Governance Dashboard.  #### Archives WG:  Stephen presented a prototype simulation utilizing MeTTa symbolic rules to illustrate a reputation system, allowing users to manipulate parameters and visualize agent interactions. See https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/288 and https://asi-chain-metta-simulation-dashboard.streamlit.app  Archives' current focus is ingestion of e.g. meeting summary data and use of AI tools in an *auditable* way - see Unified Graph Analysis Report - (Github Pages) - https://singularitynet-archive.github.io/Graph-Python-scripts/#summary and https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/Archive-RAG  We discussed the regular MeTTa group ttthat meets fortnightly, and said that Archives should share some of its current work there.  #### Treasury, Process and Knowledge Base:  Tevo explained that Knowledge Base WG has had a strategic shift to fortnightly sessions focused on preparation and brainstorming, which are recorded, to enhance collaboration and decision-making in main meetings. Treasury activities: there has been a backlog in updates related to the treasury GitHub dashboard and plans to test GitHub functionalities. Tevo Kask shared his recent coding efforts, highlighting a significant investment of time to automate a previously manual task, which has streamlined his workflow and improved prototype production. Peter acknowledged the importance of automation and the need to engage core contributors more effectively.  #### R&D, LatAm:  Guillermo gave updates on R&D and LatAm initiatives, emphasizing the importance of cultural context in AI development and the need for structured data management. The discussion also highlighted the significance of community involvement in understanding complex concepts like reputation and governance.  ## Open topics Colly Pride announced the integration of the Toridian Quantum Neural Network into OpenCog, which aims to enhance AI contextual reasoning and reduce energy consumption.   The next WG Sync Call will address the implications of the current low token price.",

People are dropping out and the Program is smaller than it was. Should we be trying to conduct some kind of exit interviews? Could be difficult to get people to take part - once they've gone, they're gone  Issues around calculating core contributor status - who is actually active, rather than merely present?",

In comparison with previous years, there was a difference in focus around the questions themselves; and the sentiment was more negative and showed a strong wish for change. But we didn't have time to analyse the reasons - possibly it's partly influenced by all the recent discussion of restructuring the program?  In this TH we did a prioritisation activity to decide which 3 questions are the most important for further discussion. The results: (how well do we organise our repetitions), Q4 (how well do we organise our reputation-building) and Q5 (do we have clear principles and roadmap).  #### Collecting feedback on Gov-Dash and AI Assistant Guillermo will be creating a video documentary to capture insights from the experiment of using the AI assistant in the Governance Dashboard. People are invited to create a short video answering the questions in this doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2dZkk8FykfVZ45ILeSRgC6zexqNW0g7d4fZVR3JPRU/edit?usp=sharing, and the videos will be edited together. People can also answer in writing in the doc itself. Deadline for contributions; Friday 12th Dec. Contributions do not necessarily have to be positive.  Reminder that Thursday's governance slot will be a final report from the temporary fundraising workgroup.",

        "narrative": "Intro: The session opened with Ese expressing concern over the low attendance in recent guild meetings. She pointed out that not only have fewer people been joining the calls, but active participation during the meetings has also declined. She asked if anyone present had attended the last session facilitated by Clement. Advance briefly recapped what was discussed in that session, and Jeffery chimed in, stating that while he had joined the call, he didn't catch enough context to contribute meaningfully or recall detailed discussions.  Highlights/Upcoming Events: Shifting the discussion toward the root of the issue, Ese asked the group how they believed participation could be improved. In response, Advance suggested that the decline might be due to financial challenges particularly referencing how the recent token price drop had affected multiple workgroups and guilds, potentially demotivating members. Building on this, UknowZork pointed out that the last two or three sessions facilitated by Duke had also seen very poor attendance, and this trend could be tied to the current bi-weekly meeting schedule, which, in her view, had dampened the spirit of the guild. She proposed returning to a weekly meeting structure to bring back engagement.  Advance supported this idea, agreeing that the bi-weekly format had reduced both effectiveness and enthusiasm among members. At this point, Ese posed a key question: 'Given our current budget and the drop in token value, can we realistically support weekly meetings?' UknowZork responded by suggesting a partial shift toward volunteerism, especially for tasks like facilitation. She proposed using these roles as mentorship opportunities where members could learn how to lead meetings, even if the tasks aren't currently funded.  While the proposal had merit, Advance expressed hesitation, indicating that while volunteerism is a thoughtful approach, it might not be sustainable at this time. Jeffery added another layer of concern, noting that it would be unfair to expect new contributors who haven't previously benefited from paid opportunities to volunteer, especially when others in the past had earned during more favorable conditions.  Recognizing all these perspectives, Ese cautioned that while the suggestions were valuable, any changes must be made carefully. She reflected on a time when the African Guild had consistently high participation and vibrant energy, but acknowledged that the token price crash played a major role in shifting that dynamic. To move forward, Advance and Jeffery both recommended reaching out directly to inactive guild members to understand their needs and encourage engagement. They also discussed the idea of sharing regular reminders in the guild's Discord channel to help boost meeting turnout.   AOB: Before wrapping up, Advance threw in a refreshing idea: 'Why don't we make the meetings more fun maybe add something cultural or playful to keep things lively?' Like little activities that remind us of home and bring back the sense of community. Ese loved the suggestion and encouraged everyone to think about creative ways we can make the sessions get lively and get more participation. The call ended on a hopeful note, with Advance offering to personally reach out to some guild members on Discord to help reignite that sense of connection.",

        "narrative": "Intro: The call opened with Clement suggesting a shift from bi-weekly to monthly meetings, citing the current low token price and our budget limitations. He proposed that the idea be discussed further with the Focus Group before making a final decision. CJFrankie supported the idea, suggesting that we hold meetings on the first Thursday of every month to help cut down on costs, especially given the unfavorable token rates. However, Advance expressed concerns about this change, emphasizing that bi-weekly meetings help maintain momentum and keep the workgroup effective. While he acknowledged that monthly meetings might ease the budget strain, he felt we should stick to the bi-weekly schedule if it's still feasible.    Highlights / Upcoming events Clement shared details about the upcoming Afro AI Multilingual Workshop in Nigeria, organized through the Education Initiative. This is the second phase of the workshop, and this time, the content will be translated into Hausa. Clement believes this approach will not only make the material more accessible but also encourage more people to learn the language. The workshop will spotlight African innovators and incorporate storytelling to foster deeper local engagement. Advance asked concerning communication around brand guidelines for flyer design and marketing support for post scheduling. If needed, the marketing team will assist with flyer design upon Clement's request, but he added that he will first check with Kizzy for clarity.   AOB: Advance asked about the next steps for the Research on Indigenous AI tools for Africans. Clement explained that while there were plans to continue, the Guild has put things on hold for now because of the current AGIX token price. They're hoping to pick it back up once the price improves.

Despite this, he highlighted the importance of staying committed to impactful initiatives, particularly the Afro Multilingual Drive Initiative a quarterly program dedicated to advancing AI literacy across African languages.  Highlights / Upcoming events Afro Multilingual Drive Initiative (September Edition) The focus for this quarter will be on protecting digital money, using a fictional story set in a Nairobi marketplace. The scenario involves a jewelry seller who uses mobile money (tentatively named M-Pesa) and is protected from fraud by an AI system called SingularityNet. This narrative will transition into an AI learning session on Fintech, cybersecurity, and financial inclusion within the African context. Clement noted that the previous editions have produced videos and storytelling scripts in Swahili, Hausa, and French. Clement invited participants, especially those involved in Fintech, cybersecurity, and finance, to share tools, concepts, or projects suitable for the initiative. He emphasized the inclusion of Afro-owned innovations and culturally relevant financial tools. While he expressed openness to prototyping new ideas and collaborating with R&D teams, Clement noted that current financial constraints may limit the scope of implementation. The event will be held on a Zoom call, and there's openness to increasing the reach and size of the audience.  Advance was invited to revisit and possibly present a previous project from Ethiopia involving AI and finance. He agreed to coordinate with Sam for a potential feature in the upcoming edition. Clement will follow up via DM to finalize details.   AOB: Jeffrey inquired about volunteer opportunities for the September event. Clement responded that volunteer coordination will be discussed in a dedicated planning session later. Clement concluded the meeting by thanking attendees and encouraging continued idea submissions via DM.",

        "narrative": "Intro: The meeting opened with Duke noting that payouts in FET rather than AGIX could ease some of the workgroup struggles, since AGIX no longer carries much utility. He admitted he had missed some meetings and wanted to catch up on direction, while Sucre joined shortly after. We briefly had discussion on the Ambassador Program, survey results, and the tension between efficiency expectations and limited resources. Duke pointed out that some groups like Strategy and Marketing Guilds were at risk of suspension due to low survey ratings, while others like Onboarding scored above thresholds. He stressed that without adequate resources, efficiency is unrealistic and workgroups can only do as much as their budgets allow.     Highlights / Upcoming events We discussed merging overlapping guilds to streamline costs, such as combining African Guild with LATAM or consolidating Marketing related groups under one umbrella. We also talked about redefining outputs for the next quarter, with African Guild focusing on outreach, events, and partnerships. Past activities like hackathons and multilingual literacy phases were highlighted as successful, though they required substantial funding. The conversation turned to sustainability: budgets are expected to shrink, and by next year, allocations may reduce further. Duke and Sucre agreed external funding was tricky, since it doesn't make sense to promote SingularityNet with another company's money. Cardano was suggested as a possible exception, but skepticism remained about its feasibility. The general consensus was that funding should come from within Deep funding or the foundation itself.  UknowZork raised a concern about the recent survey results, saying her fear was how they should brace themselves for this quarter since the survey will likely influence the budget and consent process for the next one. She pointed out that the African Guild was rated low in terms of work quality and expressed worry about how that might affect them moving forward. The discussion then circled around the challenge of producing quality work within the African Guild despite limited funding. Sucre stressed that last quarter it seemed like only one project was accomplished, and suggested the group should look for smaller activities or events that require little to no funding, things that could still keep the Guild active and engaged, maybe with just $50-$100. She also raised concerns that the Guild feels too West African or Nigerian-centric rather than pan-African, which she feels undermines its name and purpose. Advance agreed and explained that while people from other regions in Africa do exist in the ecosystem, many are more active elsewhere, often because better funding and opportunities attract them. He suggested low-cost initiatives like virtual meetups or collaborations to bring a more continental balance back. Duke expanded on this, acknowledging the reality that without strong funding, participation is hard to sustain. He emphasized that Nigerians naturally dominate because of numbers and adoption rates, but if real funding were available, people from all over Africa would join in droves. He also noted that while ideas aren't lacking, the resources to execute them are.     AOB: AOB: As the conversation wound down, Sucre proposed a practical step: everyone should come to the next meeting with two affordable project ideas. Duke backed this, saying ideas should also be collected in advance, either in a shared document or group chat, so they can be refined before the meeting. UknowZork stepped in and offered to help scout and gather ideas. There was also some back-and-forth about absent members. Should they be expected to contribute ideas too? In the end, the group decided yes: those present would bring two, while at least one should be collected from those not in attendance. The emphasis was on persistence in following up, since getting people to actually submit can be a challenge. The meeting wrapped up on a lighter note, with a few jokes and encouragement shared. Even though the group was smaller than usual, everyone agreed it had been productive and left feeling that, with a pool of new project ideas, the African Guild could keep moving forward despite the constraints.",

        "narrative": "The meeting opened with Clement welcoming everyone to the third phase of the Afro Multilingual Literacy Drive. He reminded participants that the initiative has already held a couple of series in the past, each one focused on a specific theme around learning and community growth. Today's session, he explained, would revolve around Finance, with a central theme titled: 'M-PESA & AI Guardian: Practicing Digital Money.'  To set the tone, Clement began with a short historical reflection. He began by reflecting on the past, noting how coins once served as our main form of transaction a few years back. He explained that M-PESA, widely used in Kenya, works much like what Opay and Moniepoint do in Nigeria-proving that financial innovation can be homegrown. Clement stressed that Africa is fertile ground for such innovations in financial literacy. However, he also pointed out the potential risks: digital wallets can be hacked, fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the system, and inflation can erode trust. This, he argued, is where AI can serve as a guardian, strengthening the security of Africa's digital financial systems.  Clement emphasized how platforms like M-PESA, Airtel Money, and Opay have become 'banks for the unbanked.' With nearly 60% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population still unbanked, these platforms are more than convenient-they represent digital literacy and financial inclusion.   He then moved to a more interactive part of the session. He asked the group whether anyone had personal experiences of how mobile money had impacted trade, family support, or community development in their lives. Jedidiah was the first to respond. He shared how mobile money had been a lifeline for him during particularly difficult times. He explained that in situations where access to physical cash or banks was limited, having a mobile wallet made the difference between being stranded and being supported. Duke followed by narrating his experience during the 2023 'No Cash' crisis in Nigeria, when physical currency was scarce, and daily transactions became a struggle. He recalled how PalmPay came to his rescue during a very difficult issue he faced. Since that experience, he has continued to use the platform regularly, though he admitted that he avoids keeping large sums of money in his account for safety reasons. Udoma added his own perspective, focusing on frustrations with traditional banks. He spoke about repeated cases of unnecessary charges, which he felt were unfair and exploitative. These experiences had led him to close multiple accounts over the years, further strengthening his reliance on digital platforms.  After hearing these contributions, Clement returned to the broader discussion. He pointed out that many of these digital financial platforms are now going beyond just storing money or processing transactions. Increasingly, they are integrating advanced tools that help detect fraudulent activity, verify customer identities, and even offer personalized financial advice to users. This, he suggested, demonstrates how digital money can become not only a tool of convenience but also a system of trust and guidance for users across Africa.  He then posed a thought-provoking question to the group: 'Who should own the intelligence that protects Africa's digital money?' His point was that while AI and advanced technologies can safeguard financial systems, the ownership and control of that intelligence remain a critical matter for Africa's future.  Omotayo responded firmly, saying that Africans must be the ones to own and manage such intelligence. Since the financial assets belong to African users, the control and security systems around them should also remain within African hands. He emphasized that ownership is not just about technology it is about independence and empowerment.  Duke supported this idea and expanded on it. He argued that there is no need for Africa to abandon digital platforms in favor of offline methods. Instead, Africans should be given the tools and opportunities to protect and manage their digital assets themselves, without over-reliance on external systems.  The meeting came to an end with Clement reinforcing the idea that while digital money platforms have already proven themselves as powerful tools for inclusion, the future lies in ensuring that these tools are secure, accessible, and truly African-owned. The discussion, he noted, is not just about financial convenience it is about shaping the continent's future in terms of trust, innovation, and self-reliance.",

The meeting began with a recap of the previous session, which focused on digital financial assets and traditional banking experiences in Africa. The group discussed the Q4 2025 budget, which totals $1,900, with $600 allocated to recurring tasks and the remainder split between projects and workshops. They outlined various initiatives for the quarter, including the Lean Guild Challenge, Talking Drone Dispatch, and plans for Twitter spaces and village meetings. SucrenSpice mentioned creating an alternative budget based on a lower AJX price to account for recent fluctuations.  The team introduced a new quarterly initiative: a bi-weekly newsletter titled 'Talking Drum Dispatch,' designed to engage the community using Afrocentric naming and themes. Duke explained that the newsletter would be sent to the existing email database to help convert leads into warm or hot prospects for future events and funding opportunities. The team also addressed concerns about declining meeting attendance-Duke noted that while past events attracted up to 80 participants, recent turnout has been lower.  Duke emphasized the need for renewed marketing and lead nurturing through the Talking Drum Dispatch, targeting contacts from the past year with updates on TestNet, TestNet Africa, and AI in Africa. He also outlined plans for Afro AI storytelling videos and shorts, initially conceived as part of the Green Guild Challenge. SucrenSpice and Clement assisted in retrieving relevant details from the meeting transcript to support planning.  Duke announced the launch of the Lean Guild Challenge, a new competition aimed at promoting SingularityNet, AI, AGI, and Africa through creative ideas and potential video content. While the exact competition format is still being developed, Duke suggested possible collaboration with the video workgroup and promotion via the Marketing Guild and Ambassador Program's YouTube channel. He also highlighted plans to revive X Spaces and support small, low-budget events, encouraging participants to focus on generating tangible outputs in the final two months of the quarter.  The team began planning a smaller-scale Lean creative competition with a modest $100 budget, modeled after a previous initiative. They agreed to form a focus group to structure the competition and generate ideas. Love volunteered to create a brief submission form for participants who prefer not to join live discussions. The competition will be open to both guild members and non-members, with plans to award prizes to the top three submissions-rather than just one winner-to boost participation and motivation.  The team discussed cross-guild content collaboration, agreeing to assign a delegation to engage with LATAM counterparts for Q1 2026 planning. They prioritized the first five items on their action list and began brainstorming topics for an upcoming African youth meeting. Duke suggested a topic on how AI could predict the rapture, which Love expressed interest in.",

        "narrative": "The meeting began with Duke noting that a Google Form had been shared earlier but had received no engagement. He suggested that everyone fill out the form live during the call to save time and help define the guild's direction for the quarter. Duke emphasized that without input from team members, delegation and planning could not progress. He then asked SucrenSpice to share the form so participants could complete it in real time rather than postponing it again.  SucrenSpice expressed frustration that no one besides her had completed the form, calling it disappointing given the enthusiasm from the previous meeting. Duke acknowledged her concern and mentioned his network limitations, agreeing that completing the form together would be more efficient. Once SucrenSpice shared the link, Duke encouraged everyone to take five minutes to fill it out so they could gather data to guide their ideas.  As participants worked on the form, ESE requested clarification about the 'Lean Guild Challenge,' noting that she hadn't fully understood it before. Duke explained that it was a smaller-scale version of last year's creative contests, designed to generate engagement and publicity with limited funds. He described it as a community-driven challenge open to creative proposals, where members would submit, vote, and reward winning ideas. SucrenSpice added that the entire guild would then collaborate to execute the chosen idea, distributing roles accordingly.  After collecting some responses, SucrenSpice read out the submitted ideas. Suggestions included:  Gartic Games - A drawing and guessing game inspired by SingularityNET themes.  AI Writing Challenge - A social media challenge focused on AI and Singularity Africa, with engagement-based rewards.  Digital Handshake & Story Map - Members pin their locations on a shared map and write one sentence about their connection to Africa ('My Africa is...').  Problem and Possibility Seed Bank - Members share one local problem and one potential solution, creating a pool of future project ideas.  Six-Word SNET Story - Participants summarize their vision for Africa or SingularityNET in six words, with recognition for the most creative entries.  SNET Impact Challenge (#StickTheChange) - A social media movement where participants showcase how they're using AI or community action to make a difference in Africa. The campaign would include regional leaderboards, weekly highlights, and rewards for impactful contributions.  As the guild reviewed the ideas, participants discussed creating short labels and descriptions to simplify the voting process. A quick poll was conducted, and ESE's Impact Challenge received six votes, emerging as the winning concept. Duke asked ESE to document the idea clearly and share it soon so execution could begin, noting the short two-month quarter and limited meeting schedule. ESE agreed to draft the document, initially proposing next week, but SucrenSpice and Duke encouraged an earlier deadline-preferably Monday. ESE later confirmed she would share a preliminary version soon, even if brief.  Toward the end of the meeting, SucrenSpice proposed running multiple projects concurrently-such as Twitter Spaces, Afro-storytelling video shorts, and other initiatives-to avoid delays and ensure all quarterly goals were met. Duke agreed, emphasizing that future meetings would focus on review and execution rather than ideation. He encouraged members to select specific roles or tasks they were interested in, stressing the importance of delegation moving forward.  To streamline coordination, SucrenSpice offered to create a shared project tracker listing ongoing and upcoming initiatives, including Talking Drum, physical meetups, newsletters, X Spaces, and videos, allowing members to indicate where they could contribute. Duke endorsed the idea, thanked everyone for their input, and reminded the team that the quarter was already underway-prompt action was critical.  The meeting concluded on a cooperative and motivated note, with Duke expressing appreciation to all present members for their participation and commitment.",

        "narrative": "Intro: The meeting, facilitated by Duke, opened with a clarification about the rescheduling confusion that followed the BGI Summit. Members acknowledged lapses in communication, which had caused several participants to miss the previous meeting. Duke asked whether to proceed with the small turnout or postpone until more members joined. After brief discussion, the group agreed to continue since key matters-task assignments, budgeting, and next steps required attention.    Highlights / Key Discussions 1. Task Sheet Review and Participation Duke shared the task sheet that had been circulated two weeks earlier, outlining all planned activities for the quarter. He noted that participation in filling it out had been minimal, though most of the contributors were present. As he shared his screen, the group reviewed the task list, which included initiatives like the Lean Guild Challenge, Afro-AI storytelling, Twitter Spaces, newsletters, and a physical meeting in Abuja.  Members exchanged light banter as Duke pointed out that UnowZork's name appeared across nearly every section, drawing playful comments about being the team's 'bulldozer.'  2. Task Redistribution and Role Balancing During the discussion, Martin volunteered for additional responsibilities, while SucrenSpice suggested that UnowZork narrow down their roles to create room for others. Duke clarified that holding multiple roles wasn't an issue as long as participation remained balanced. After brief adjustments, assignments were redistributed: 1. Clement, Martin, and Kateri took on newly defined roles. 2. UnowZork and Udoma retained two to three key tasks each.  SucrenSpice reminded everyone that focusing on one core deliverable per person would ensure efficiency and accountability.  3. Assignments and Deliverables Each member's responsibilities were clarified as follows: 1. Lean Guild Challenge: Team to begin work immediately and coordinate with Ese for design and publicity. 2. Newsletters (Nov-Dec): Martin to draft and submit for review to Duke or SucrenSpice before publishing. 3. Afro-AI Storytelling: Clement and Udoma to finalize scripts and video production concepts. 4. Twitter Space Event: Lola to lead coordination and hosting. 5. Physical Village Meeting (Abuja): Duke and Udoma to handle logistics and planning. 6. Cross-Guild Content: UnowZork to collaborate with the LATAM team. 7. Quarterly Showcase: SucrenSpice to compile a consolidated presentation of all outputs.  The tone remained upbeat, with a mix of humor and productivity as the group confirmed roles and deliverables.  4. Budget and Resource Efficiency When budget constraints surfaced, Duke encouraged minimizing costs by having the same individuals handle multiple related tasks for instance, combining infographic design and publicity duties. SucrenSpice clarified that Esther's role in the Lean Guild Challenge would remain facilitative, not as an additional paid implementer.  Duke emphasized that all teams should begin their assigned tasks immediately, with some outputs particularly publicity materials and newsletter drafts expected by the following week.    AOB: As the conversation wound down, Duke proposed a practical step: Everyone should maintain consistent communication to prevent rescheduling confusion, balance task distribution to ensure shared workload and efficiency, prioritize low-cost, high-impact deliverables given limited funding and ensure all assignments have visible progress before the next session.",

He also mentioned the work with Lola and how it is falling in place.   Lean Guild Challenge: Uknowzork noted that they hadn't been able to reach ESE regarding the Lean Guild Challenge because she had been offline.   Team Reorganization and Reward Adjustments: SucrenSpice announced a restructuring of team roles, including reassigning Kateri and Ese to focus on the Lean Guild Challenge, while moving Uknowzork into the Twitter Community/X space role previously handled by Kateri and the removal of Martinsoki from the Village Meeting. SucrenSpice also addressed changes to the rewards distribution, noting that the drop in token price reduced the total available funds from 1,800 USD to 1,050 USD. The rewards will now be issued in AGIX tokens to preserve their value.  Duke offered to help Martinsoki learn System.io by finding a suitable video tutorial. Martinsoki added that he is currently watching YouTube lessons to better understand how to use the platform.  Email Marketing Strategy: Duke and Martinsoki reviewed the current email marketing approach. Duke noted that the existing educational-style content might result in a low open rate and suggested shifting to a more direct, action-focused style aligned with direct response copywriting. He also proposed revisiting the setup of the email marketing platform to support this improved structure. Both agreed to schedule a follow-up call to further refine the email content and overall strategy.  Twitter Space Event Coordination: The team reviewed plans for the upcoming Twitter Space event scheduled for next Thursday, emphasizing the need to coordinate with Lola to finalize the event flyer. Duke faced technical issues and had to leave the meeting early, so the team agreed to continue the conversation asynchronously. Colly offered support for any questions or challenges that might come up. The discussion concluded with a reminder to reach out to Lola promptly to confirm all event details.",

SucrenSpice briefly restated the guild's mission: advancing decentralized AI adoption, education, and innovation across Africa. The focus then shifted to reviewing the initiatives planned for Q4 and assessing what was completed.                          Highlights / Upcoming events The SNET Impact challenge was highlighted as one of the quarter's biggest successes. Kateri shared that her role involved background support, while Ese worked directly with participants. The challenge received about 12 submissions showcasing how Africans are using AI, generated strong social media engagement, and attracted new members to SingularityNet. We agreed that the quality of submissions, especially those focused on education, was encouraging.   The Talking Drum Dispatch was discussed next. Martinsoki led the November edition, which covered AI innovations across Africa, SingularityNet updates, AI governance training in Kenya, and an Angolan logistics company using AI. The December edition is currently in progress, and members were encouraged to read and engage with the shared dispatch. Next we discussed the virtual event hosted and held in Abuja.  The village meeting was described as a standout event. Although most people  couldn't attend due to distance, reports and videos showed strong impact, with around 45 new participants introduced to SingularityNet. The culturally grounded, in-person format was widely praised as one of the guild's best events so far.  Updates were also given on ongoing and postponed initiatives. The community Twitter/X Space is still in progress due to login issues and may take place soon or move into the new year. Cross-guild collaboration with the LATAM guild and the planned AI video content were moved to the next quarter because of funding and availability challenges.  Looking ahead: We discussed plans for 2026, focusing on sustaining and scaling successful initiatives, expanding the reach of the Talking Drum Dispatch, growing the guild's presence in academic institutions and tech communities, and organizing more workshops to to simplify decentralized AI and make SingularityNet more accessible across Africa.   AOB:  UknowZork asked about the short AI videos that were planned for the quarter and SucrenSpice confirmed that the team assigned to the task had been unavailable and that the initiative would be moved to Q1, with funds still intact. With no further questions, the meeting was wrapped up.",

Transcription tasks: these were all completed by the due date at the end of July  Co-Chair (Vani):  Vani has been reorganising the folder structure on the BGI Nexus drive where interview material and transcripts are stored. Esther and Vani are discussing whether to retain or delete the original (non-anonymised) recordings - likely they will be deleted to avoid accidentally sharing them. Once all this Quarter's interviews are done, Vani will be verifying interview validity and sending the tasks for payment.  WG Internal Management (Sucre n Spice): Sucre's work is progressing well for this Quarter; she has somewhat less to do than in previous Quarters due to lower token price, the Workgroup has fewer paid tasks that need processing.   WG Async Work Support (Love): Work is going as planned; no blockers.   Transcript checking (Vani): in progress; no blockers, although checking ranscripts is always quite slow work.  Interviews: Deadline for Q3 interviews is 8th August. If any interview is not done by then, tbe budget for it will either be reassigned to someone else, or returned to the pot. The assignees are Clement(2x), Grandi(2x), UknowZork(2x), Rems, and Jeffrey. The validity criteria will be similar to previous quarters, but with a slight tweak to the thresholds for part-paying interviews that are too short.  Conferences & Events: Nothing concrete yet about any potential involvement in the BGI-25 conference in October 2025 in Istanbul. Vani will meet with Esther later this month to discuss.   We discussed how to manage payments given the current low token price - see 'Decisions' below.",

        "narrative": "#### AI Ethics MOOC  As agreed, we revisited the idea of joining a MOOC and meeting to discuss. Some members (Gorga, Alfred, MaxMilez, Guillermo, Vani) are still interested despite pressure of other work. FutureLearn (3-week course) and Coursera (4 weeks) were agreed on the best options as they are relatively short. Final decision will be made async, and we'll aim to start soon and review progress during the November meeting.  #### BGI-25 Several workgroups (R&D, LatAm, Archives, ThinkTank, and (tbc) African Guild) will be presenting sessions via Zoom on Day 3 of the conference (23rd October), which is an 'Unconference' (a more paricipatory, less planned event where anyone can present a session).  AI Ethics WG is taking a co-ordinating role for this, and will also be presenting a session to showcase our research work. We assigned Sucre as presenter, Love as facilitator, and Lola as documenter for our session.   Esther and Vani are preparing web text connecting the BGI 25 Unconference to the ambassador programs. A draft will be ready by tomorrow or soon after, and final breakout room timings will be added once confirmed.  We discussed what should be said in the session. Group members highlighted the cultural advantages of interviewer-interviewee alignment, noting that shared backgrounds especially within West African contexts often yield richer and more authentic responses. Members raised concerns about interviewee diversity and the risk of over-centralizing certain perspectives within the research. The group also considered the challenges and benefits of conducting interviews in non-English languages, recognizing the potential for deeper engagement and more nuanced insights; and mentionbed the importance of how we train interviewers and transcribers  WG members were invited to contribute async any further personal insights on interviews and transcription processes by the Wednesday, and these will be incorporated ino the presentation. There will be a final planning meeting this Wednesday at 9 a.m. UTC to finalize breakout content.  This work is funded directly by the Foundation, not from the WG budget.  #### Interview coding Merry (Mariia), an intern supporting Esther with qualitative research, introduced herself. She has been coding the WG's interviews and has so far completed 4. She will be taking part in the group's session at the BGI-25 virtual unconference to present early findings.  #### Budget fitting The Q4 2025 budget, initially approved at an exchange rate of $0.28, was reviewed due to volatile and lower actual rates.  Budget items cancelled: community engagement work (other than BGI-25); coding interviews.  Budget items reduced: 11 transcripts rather than the planned 14. These adjustments bring the equivalent rate to a safer $0.22. The workgroup agreed to maintain a cautious approach, with further reviews planned for November based on exchange rate developments.  #### Q4 2025 tasks Interviewing and transcription tasks were assigned. We noted that Jeffrey completed a bonus interview in the previous quarter; his payment will be processed in the current one. We also assigned meeting documentation tasks for this Quarter's meetings. Vani will add all tasks to the github board in the coming week.  #### Payment structure for short interviews Reminder that interviewers should aim for 30 mins or more of actual interview material (i.e. not counting introductions, going through the consent form, etc). If they don't reach this, the payment structure is     25 mins and upward - full pay, $25     20-25 mins: $15     10-20 mins: $10     Under 10 mins: $0  We also confirmed that Vani will offer support via DM to first-time interviewers if they need it.",

Vani will update the board.  #### AI Ethics MOOC:  The idea of doing a MOOC as a group has been on the agenda for long. Last meeting, we said we would co-ordinate async and start attending one (either Coursera or FutureLearn), but it didn't happen due to people's lack of time; so we agreed to close the issue. The idea can always be revisited in future.  #### Q4 2025 budget: Last meeting, we made some budget-fitting cuts, and agreed that the WG admin team will keep an eye on things. But with the token price now extremely low, adjusting the rate again no longer makes sense. We agreed that we will instead move to calculating task prices in AGIX.  This means that the payment for tasks in real terms will be very low - but if prices do rise, then payees will benefit (as long as they have been able to hold their AGIX, rather than offramping immediately). But if people feel that the payments are now too low in real terms for it to be worth them completting tasks that are assigned to them, this is understandable.  The admin team have already elected to take their Q4 payment in advance . Other contributors were asked via Discord last week to indicate their preferred option directly on their GitHub issue - to be paid immediately the task is completed; to wait until the end of the Quarter for payment; or to not complete the task. If they choose not to complete the task, we will try to leave it assigned to them and carry over to next Quarter when hopefully token price will be better - though this does depend on budget decisions for Q1 2026 and whether or not the WG is still doing the task in question.  #### Outstanding tasks from earlier Quarters • A few older transcription tasks remain, including reassigned items from past quarters. • Merry is assisting with transcript checking, so that we can get this completed faster • All task-specific updates will be managed on the GitHub board.  #### Interviewing & Transcription Tasks (Q4): • Interview and transcription task updates were shared (see GitHub board for details) - most people have elected to continue with tasks and are on track to meet deadlines, but a few have asked for the task to be carried over to next Quarter  #### Interview coding session: • A short introductory session on interview coding, led by Esther, is scheduled for 3rd December. This will be a simple walkthrough on identifying themes, tags, and patterns in interview transcripts.  #### 'Hearing the Silenced Voices':  BGI Nexus Ideation Round The WG admin team have submitted a proposal to the current BGI-Nexus ideation round, drawing on the WG's experiences of researching with the public in Africa, and focusing on AI-supported interviewer training for marginalized communities. It aims to help local interviewers engage with their own demographic groups. If successful, the proposal will eventually lead to the creation of an RFP for solutions to address the issue of training interviewers from marginalised communities, to which WG members will be able to submit proposals.",

        "narrative": "#### End Of Year Report The Program's end-of-year report for 2025 will be drawn from WGs' mini Q4 impact statements; we reviewed our WG's report in the Governance dashboard. Colleen suggested adding a note about the  MOOC study group on AI ethics being pushed to January, and Vani agreed pending the fixes to the Governance Dashboard editor (at present, in order to make an edit, you have to re-input the entire report).   #### Ambassador Programme Restructure Vani updated the group on the planned restructuring of the Ambassador Program, as discussed in the workgroup sync call earlier today. Governance WG is collecting community input via two open documents: One with structured prompts https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGzJoi1bLJvMAd59vmx_NL1kQkUXcLri-BFkZK-NcJU/edit?usp=sharing One fully open for any redesign ideas (small improvements or radical proposals) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fwCGlTls_bHBJ46ejF9wXZXOCfB7eEnmZeAhSbP9axQ/edit?usp=sharing  We discussed ideas for the restructure from the perspective of this WG.  Colleen suggested increasing support for builders, possibly combining R&D and AI Sandbox/Think Tank to focus on that, and developing a structured onboarding process for new builders.   Peter pointed out that we have 'builder-related' focus in several WGs - while it's good for different groups to be building, there might be overlaps that could be brought together.   Vani suggested a more quarter-by-quarter, project-based approach for WGs to define what they are building each Quarter so we can see where the overlaps are, but we wouldn't necessarily want them to merge - the diversity of approach have been useful so far. On the question of *what* we build - she suggested we should focus on using the ASI tech stack, and on building a) governance tools for decentralised communities, and b) building governance and ethical processes and methodologies, and embedding AI ethics and decentralised governance into what we build, because governance is one of our strengths. Similar to the approach LatAm are already using - they build on the ASI tech stack, then they promote and publicise what they built; 'ambassadorship' means promoting use of sNET's technology.  We discussed how our ethics discussions might overlap with Sandbox/Think Tank  Should this workgroup's main activity continue to be supporting the BGI Nexus research project? Or are there other things we should do? If the focus of the Ambassador Program shifts more towards building, how do we ensure ethical considerations are embedded in that? and engage more directly with builders and asking 'What are the ethical issues raised by what you are building?' Colleen would like to continue faciliating community discussions on ethics, as she has done before, but (based on dicussions with Dr Mihaela Ulieru) with more of a focus on baking in foundational principles for builders and developers, and living, dynamic moral generator functions.  We could also work to inform and educate the general public on what this technology can do, and what the social and ethical implications of it are. Insights from interviewing can feed into this crystallising of ethical and social meaning of the technology - 2 way process of sense-making - the public tells us how they see the technology, and we tell them how we see it?   Vani and Esther have discussed the idea of this WG moving some of its function away from the Ambassador Program, and at least partly being more directly part of BGI -Nexus, and funded by them. It's not out of the question, and could have some advantages, but a) it would be heavily dependent on token price as to whether BGI Nexus could afford it, and b) it might affect our independence/autonomy if we were completely part of BGI Nexus? It would be good to retain some kind of ethics WG in the program.  Another possibility that has been discussed in the past could be a direct funding pipeline from BGI Nexus for small ethics-related projects.   #### Interview coding session The training session on interview coding that was planned for December 3rd has been rescheduled to January because Esther is very busy at the moment.   #### BGI-25 Virtual Unconference progress:  Treasury has already sent out payments! Much speedier than payments for previous work funded direct from the Foundation - thanks to Esther and Peter for their work on expediting it  The short videos prepared by Video WG from the BGI sessions will be uploaded to SNET's YouTube, and the full-length videos of the breakout rooms will be on the Ambassador Program YouTube channel. Esther and Vani plan to meet on hursday with Pam from the Foundation's marketing team to organise this; and Peter will be able to help with ensuring material is shared.   #### Task updates We reviewed the transcription and interview tasks on the Github board: Several tasks, particularly transcription, are uncompleted - people elected not to complete them because, after our decision last month to calculate task prices in AGIX, the pay for the task is so much lower than it was due to low token price. Alfred shared (with humor) that his transcription almost defeated him, but guilt wouldn't let him quit, and he will finish them later today. We agreed that any task not wrapped up by tomorrow will shift into Q1 2026, provided it still fits the project's planned work. Vani's pending transcript-checking tasks, especially for last Quarter, are still pending because there isn't the money to pay them so they aren't a priority - but she will aim to complete them as soon as possible.   #### Budget & payments Payments for those who wanted to be paid immediately on task completion have already been processed. Those who opted to be paid at the end of the Quarter will be paid this Thursday (final Treasury payment day).  Going into Q1, we agreed that we will continue calculating task prices in AGIX, to avoid the need for constant budget-fitting and rethinking while token price is so volatile. We acknowledged that this is not ideal, as it shifts the burden/risk of token price fluctuations to the individual rather than the Program; but with price so low at present (around $0.09) there's no alternative.   #### Priorities and budget for Q1 2026 There is no biudget consent process for Q1, to keep admin overheads down at a time of very low token price. So we will have the same budget cap as this Quarter, and the admin team will see how things are in January and decide how much work we can afford to do. But today, we discussed what the prioroties should be in Q1.  Love noted that we should focus on clearing the transcription backlog instead of doing more interviewing, so that we have more completed interview material that can be coded and analysed. Everyone agreed that this was the most realistic direction.  Alfred raised that transcription is difficult and currently undercompensated, and takes far longer than expected. We all acknowledged that payment for ttranscription needs to be higher in Q1, despite low token price.  Zork suggested adjusting payments to track the token price, but Vani noted fairness concerns that if people are doing the same work, they may end up being paid differently depending on timing   #### Kickoff session for BGI Nexus Working Groups Peter reminded everyone that the first BGI-Nexus working groups session will take place tomorrow, 2nd December, and is open to all. This is the start of BGI Nexus's project to create open working groups to progress their work on various aspects of AI ethics, governance and safety. There will be breakout rooms on: - AGI for Human Flourishing / Nurturing & Governing AGI - The Consciousness Revolution - Proactionary vs Precautionary Approaches to AGI",

          "Open discussion:  Ethical and regulatory issues and how researchers based AI could be going to prevent misuse? Peter stated that being centralized is being governed by single body and so could use AI for different application and sometimes it's not properly governed which could cause harm. Ashley stated that establishing government work can help prevent the misuse of the centralized AI because the most complied to the existing regulations and such as data protection and privacy laws.  Security and trust, how can decentralized AI ensure secured data, transmission, and storage to prevent data breaches? Vasu stated that some of the companies have some biases upon trust and it has become a trust issue and not a security issue.  How can AI models improve without centralizing the data? Ashley stated that using secured aggregation techniques such as combining data from multiple source in which ensure confidentiality of the data. It will ensure secure data transmission and storage.  Will decentralized AI become the mainstream or will centralized AI always dominate? Peter said that is a believer in decentralized AI compared to centralized. But if people are using something they don't care about centralized vs decentralized, they just care about using it."

          "Glimpse of What the upcoming session of AI Roundtable in Think Tank is going to be like by Lordkizzy on this Roundtable: The AI Roundtable and Think Tank sessions are designed to create an interactive environment where participants can share diverse perspectives on artificial intelligence (AI) topics. The discussions focus on exploring ethical dilemmas, technical challenges, and the broader implications of AI on society. The goal is to foster critical thinking, collaborative ideation, and open discussions without the pressure of competition.  Discussion Goals:   - To examine the societal, economic, and cultural impacts of artificial intelligence and machine learning.  - To debate emerging frameworks and ethical dilemmas surrounding AI technologies and their applications.  - To encourage innovation and critical thinking through diverse perspectives and collaborative discussions.  Proposed Discussion Structures:  - Panel Debate:     a. Two teams (proposition and opposition) engage in a structured discussion on a specific AI-related topic.  Each team consists of two members who prepare arguments and counterarguments.     b. This format allows for in-depth intellectual exchanges and encourages participants to explore different perspectives on the topic.  - Breakout Discussions:     a. Larger groups are divided into smaller teams to discuss the same topic from the proposition and opposition sides.     b. This setup promotes open collaboration and critical thinking within smaller groups before reconvening for a collective discussion.  Debate Structure and Format:   a. Panel Debate: Two teams, each consisting of two members, engage in a structured discussion where one side supports the topic and the other opposes it.  b. Breakout Discussions: Larger groups are divided into smaller teams, with each team representing either the proposition or the opposition side, fostering collaboration and idea development before joining a larger collective discussion.  The debate structure selection will be determined through a poll that will be created on the Discord Channel.  No Winners or Losers: The focus is on learning and understanding diverse perspectives rather than competition.The format promotes open dialogue and collaboration, providing a safe space for sharing ideas and critical thinking.It aims to deepen understanding of complex issues through collective brainstorming and discussions, enhancing learning outcomes for all participants.  Knowledge-Based Graph for Documentation: Knowledge-based graphs will be created to capture key insights and arguments from the discussions. These graphs will help document and structure the discussions, making it easier to retrieve information and understand complex topics.The graphs will also support collaborative learning by documenting diverse perspectives and facilitating knowledge sharing among participants.  Reports Shared with the Community: Reports will be compiled from the discussions, offering structured analysis of the key arguments and insights shared during the sessions. These reports will be accessible through a centralized platform, ensuring transparency and fostering ongoing engagement within the community for future reference."

          "The meeting took off by LordKizzy welcoming everyone present.",
          "The discussion centered on the decentralized platform NUNET, my name is Jennifer and I am the marketing community leader here at NUNET. NUNET is a open source decentralized platform that's designed to create globally accessible and democratized network for computing power. likening its operation to Uber in how it matches supply and demand for computing tasks. NuNet optimizes the allocation of computational tasks across a peer-to-peer network, which eliminates bottlenecks and hopefully will reduce costs as well. So NUNET was designed to address the limitations of centralized cloud infrastructure, which is often expensive, restrictive, and controlled by a few large providers or players in the space. The orchestration layer of NUNET efficiently assigns workloads to devices, while blockchain technology ensures secure micro-payments, providing a flexible alternative to traditional cloud services, particularly beneficial for AI and IoT applications.",
          "Samski explained the structural differences between NUNET decentralized public cloud infrastructure and centralized public cloud infrastructure systems such as AWS Google, etcetera, they basically have private data centers with very specific hardware, operating systems and everything that runs on top of that is containerized or virtualized. He emphasized that NUNET allows for community-run data centers and operates on a peer-to-peer network, which contrasts with the centralized management and orchestration systems. Additionally, he noted the integration of blockchain technology for payment and security, further enhancing the decentralized nature of NUNET. He also discussed the complexities of the existing command-line interface for the Decentralized Management System (DMS) and the development of a more user-friendly appliance that integrates best practices for operating systems and security, which can be deployed on various hardware.",
          "Overview of DMS and Appliance Development Samski explained that the DMS currently operates primarily through a command-line interface, which can be a barrier for users not accustomed to such environments. He detailed the functionalities, including workload specifications and deployment options, and emphasized the intention to develop an appliance that simplifies the user experience. This appliance will bundle essential utilities and security measures to enhance the management and monitoring of devices.",
          "Installation and Configuration of NUNET Appliance on Windows Samski led a demonstration on installing the NUNET appliance on Windows, emphasizing the need to extract files and run the installer with administrative privileges. He addressed a question from Peter regarding Multipass defaulting to a drive with insufficient space, suggesting a solution involving creating a mount point. Vasu recommended using a Google Drive link for sharing the installation files. Samski provided an overview of the NUNET virtual appliance installation, showcasing the MultiPass GUI as a user-friendly interface. He detailed how users can manage the appliance through a shortcut that displays its status and allows for operations like starting and stopping. Additionally, he mentioned the installation of Docker and DMS, emphasizing the importance of obtaining a peer ID for network connectivity.",
          "Overview of Decentralized Encryption and Network Capabilities In the demonstration, Samski showcased the process of joining the NUNET testnet and utilizing the Wormhole encryption tool to send and receive decentralized identifiers (DIDs). He highlighted the ability for users to authorize each other and bid on deployments while ensuring that only trusted organizations can run deployments on the network. This approach aims to maintain order and build trust within the community as the network develops.",
          "LordKizzy said a big thank you to the NUNET team, on behalf of the ambassador program, and also AI Sandbox community. So thank you for your valuable insights and basically educating us. And yeah, he would also love to have you guys on more of our sessions. Where we can look at the applications and also the use cases. LordKizzy raised questions for a feedback form where by members can write their issues faced while test running the application. Samski said there's an application form to join the NUNET program where by doing that, you can submit your DID and then join the NUNET organization. And as part of that whole process, there's a whole kind of support process around that. I think there's a blog post, if it's not going out today, then it's going out on Monday. There's a bunch of onboarding videos that basically goes through what I've just shown you here for Windows, Linux and Mac."

She noted that users would receive notifications for updates without needing to uninstall previous versions, although those who used multipass would need to reinstall. Lordkizzy sought clarification on containerization and the public launch timeline, with Bube confirming that the appliance release had been delayed until the following day.",

While planned theoretical debates were delayed, there's still a chance to host them before the quarter ends. Roundtable discussions and project showcases were paused. Bi-weekly sessions alternating between Sandbox and Think Tank continued as usual, and four new members joined the workgroup - UknowZork, Jeffrey, Alfred, and Max Milez.",

In response, Kizzy explained the AI Sandbox and Think-tank structure, and with Osmium, highlighted the value of the program GitBook for deeper understanding. Kateri noted meetings felt too formal and suggested bringing back engaging formats like debates. Advance appreciated the enriching impact of discussion and debate sessions and recommended clearer agendas and collaboration with other guilds to better tailor showcases. Kizzy supported this, stressing the need to align tools with workgroup needs. Lastly, Osmium mentioned speaking with Peter about a demo on the ASI wallet to explore the token's utility."

          "Introduction and welcome: The meeting kicked off with Lordkizzy welcoming everyone and  Osmium shared the agenda for the day's meeting",
          "Discussion on Agenda item: Osmium displayed the Agenda item and he proposed that we have discussions and debate on it.",
          "Should open source AI be considered a digital right or a privilege?   Kizzy noted that he's not quite familar with rights but he could give context to it. He mentioned that he doesn't feel AI should get rights over digital content it creates; he feels that the rights should be given to the creators of the AI. He noted that it shouldn't be a right but a privilege.   Vani in response noted that access to open-source AI should go beyond simply having the right to use it, it must also include explainability, and proper education on HOW to use it. People need to understand how AI works, especially that chatbots don't think or feel like humans, despite sounding like they do. Without this understanding, users can easily be misled. Therefore, comprehensive, accessible information should be provided, not only for using AI tools but also for building and critically engaging with them.   Vasu agrees that open-source AI is valuable, but expressed concern over the lack of clear regulations. He drew a parallel to how China initially allowed Bitcoin mining but later imposed restrictions due to concerns over digital autonomy. Similarly, he believes there should be thoughtful regulation around AI use to ensure it is applied responsibly and doesn't lead to unintended consequences.",
          "Who gets to decide which AI models are safe enough to be public?  Lordkizzy points out that there is currently no central authority regulating the release of AI models, leaving safety judgments to the users themselves. He argues that introducing strict regulations could slow down technological progress, especially for open-source AI, where public feedback is essential for development. Developers rely on real-world testing to improve their models, and too many restrictions might block that process. In his view, the public should continue to play the key role in determining what is safe or harmful. He highlighted the variety of AI models available and emphasizes that users like video editors should be free to choose what works best for them. He warns that government regulation could disproportionately harm small or independent developers who lack the resources of large organizations. Centralized regulation might favor big players, stifling innovation from smaller creators. Therefore, he believes the decision of what AI tools are safe and useful should rest with the users, not a central authority.   UknowZork raised a question in chats: 'How do we ensure global safety when AI is borderless?'. And she stated that developers should try to prove their models are safe before release a sentiment that aligns with growing global concerns over AI's unpredictable reach and influence.  Vani reflected that while it's unclear who should ultimately decide AI safety, any decision depends on developers being transparent about the risks and implications of their models. Developers may not always consider ethical impacts, either unintentionally or due to their focus on technical progress. To address this, she suggests establishing clear protocols that outline what safety-related information must be provided to enable informed assessments by users or regulators.   Vasu expressed concerns that big players like OpenAI make critical decisions behind closed doors without transparent or inclusive mechanisms, which undermines public trust.  Advance proposed that each continent should establish its own representative body made up of informed users and stakeholders who understand AI. Drawing from examples like U.S. initiatives where CEOs, economists, lawyers, and business leaders are consulted, he suggests these diverse perspectives are essential for shaping fair and democratic AI policies. Such bodies could ensure that global AI governance reflects regional values and priorities while remaining inclusive and future-focused.",
          "Can decentralized ecosystems like SingularityNET provide a safer, scalable alternative to centralized AI?:   Lordkizzy reflected on past comparisons in AI Sandbox sessions, where outputs and capabilities of different AI models were assessed. He explained that the foundation of projects like Ocean Protocol is rooted in the mission to challenge dominant, closed AI companies like OpenAI. While acknowledging the difficulty due to limited resources compared to big firms, he believes the broader goal of these open communities is to push the boundaries of AI advancement and scalability through collective innovation.  Vasu explained that open-source AI drives rapid innovation through community collaboration-much like Linux where issues are quickly fixed and systems evolve together. Unlike closed, profit-driven models, open AI like LLM let people tailor technology to their cultures and values, sparking new AI economies. But this openness also brings challenges around governance and accountability.  Santos expressed concern about the safety and accountability of decentralized AI systems. While centralized AI models may currently seem safer because responsibility lies with a specific company, decentralized models create ambiguity, especially when something goes wrong. He questioned who should be held accountable if, for instance, a harmful AI application is built on an open platform like ASI Mini. This highlights a core tension: decentralized AI promotes openness and innovation but currently lacks the clear accountability structures found in centralized systems.  Vani reflected on a cultural shift where people may soon assume that most media - photos, videos, news - is AI-generated and likely false. This challenges traditional ideas of harm, which often hinge on whether something is factually true. She suggested that as believability declines, the focus may shift to assessing the vulnerability of those impacted, rather than just the content's accuracy. For example, even AI-generated abuse imagery is still deeply harmful, despite not being 'real,' showing that intent and impact can matter more than truth in determining harm.   Vasu agreed with Vani that people are becoming accustomed to AI-generated content, but he believes society is also responding by seeking authenticity. He points to emerging social media platforms like BeReal and Mindplex, which emphasize posting real, minimally AI-altered content. These platforms often include factual verification mechanisms, offering a counterbalance to the flood of synthetic media and helping rebuild trust through genuine, verifiable interactions.",
          "What parallels can we draw between open-source software movements and open AI?   Vani noted that there's no government deciding on how open source software is regulated - it's something that developers do themselves in a decentralised way. She suggested that maybe OpenAI can learn from that.   Vasu added that while open-source software like Linux is built on editable code layers, AI models are fundamentally different due to their probabilistic nature and complexity. Unlike traditional software, modifying or retraining AI models requires significant resources, expertise, and access, making them less accessible for community-driven development. AI tools integrate advanced capabilities and often need specialized deployment setups (e.g., APIs, tele-sensing), making the open-source AI landscape harder to manage and govern than classic software projects.",
          "Would granting access to AI as a right reduce global inequality-or widen the misuse gap?  Lordkizzy argued that formally granting rights or imposing regulations on AI use is unlikely to increase global inequality or the misuse gap. Currently, AI is accessible without much restriction, and both beneficial and harmful uses already coexist. In his view, introducing rights or structured access might actually help curb misuse by creating clearer guidelines and responsibilities, leading to more ethical and balanced use of AI across different regions and user groups.  Vasu added that AI misuse is inevitable, but rather than letting that dominate the conversation, the focus should be on establishing governance that is thoughtful yet non-restrictive. He suggests moving toward a shared understanding ('mutual deposit') on the issue, and emphasizes that any regulatory framework should protect freedoms and encourage innovation, rather than impose rigid controls that could hinder progress.  Santos noted that granting rights to AI access could have both positive and negative effects. On one hand, global inequality may worsen if some countries embrace open-source AI while others, like North Korea, refuse it, leading to uneven access. On the other hand, misuse is unavoidable, especially given AI's internet-based nature. Drawing a parallel to the dark web, he noted that lack of control can turn promising technologies into harmful ones, reinforcing the need for thoughtful oversight without expecting to eliminate all risks.  Vani argued that the potential for misuse shouldn't determine whether people are granted rights, just as we wouldn't deny voting rights to marginalized groups based on how they might vote. She challenged the idea that marginalized users are more likely to misuse AI, suggesting instead that those in power and privilege are more prone to unethical behavior to protect their status. Ultimately, she viewed the debate over misuse as a distraction from the more important principle: rights are granted because they are just, not because they're risk-free.",
          "Can open-source AI be governed ethically at a global scale without censorship?  Santos emphasized that censorship is unavoidable when AI is deployed on a global scale. He used TikTok as an example to explain how censorship operates-even in widely used platforms-where certain language or content is restricted. He believes that similarly, open-source AI will face censorship if governed by a central authority or higher power like a government. If the content or capabilities of an AI model are deemed unfit for public use, that authority will likely restrict or suppress it, making full openness difficult to maintain under global oversight. He suggested that because different regions have varying norms and sensitivities, governing bodies will always exist to filter or restrict certain uses, making total openness difficult in practice."

          "- Pro-Human Attribution: 'AI is just a tool - authorship belongs to the human.' AdvanceAmeyaw presented foundational pro-human position: AI is just a tool, authorship belongs to humans who create and control AI systems.AI systems are fundamentally designed and programmed by humans, meaning that the creativity and intent behind their functionality originate from human authorship. The data used to train AI models is sourced from human-generated content, reinforcing the idea that AI operates as an extension of human knowledge and capabilities. Legal and ethical considerations regarding AI outputs emphasize that accountability and ownership should rest with the humans who develop and deploy these technologies. Santos said that AI is an assistant that enhances human capabilities ('we should [use] AI assistant') but stresses that humans should remain in charge ('pro-human'). They acknowledge AI's potential but may be wary of it surpassing human control, emphasizing that its programming binds its actions.Lord_Kizzy used a pencil analogy: humans decide intent and usage of tools, making humans accountable for outcomes rather than the tool itself. Humans possess the cognitive ability to determine how tools are used, which directly influences the outcomes of their actions. The intent behind using a tool, such as a pencil, is rooted in human decision-making, making individuals responsible for the consequences of their actions. Accountability for negative outcomes resulting from tool usage emphasizes the ethical responsibility of humans over the tools themselves. UknowZork Said Ai is not just a tool for me . It's a powerful tool that I use to streamline tasks, brainstorm creatively and make decisions more effectively. It enhance my work but doesn't replace critical thinking.",
          "- Discussion of Clark and Chalmers' 1998 extended mind theory suggesting AI extends human cognitive capabilities rather than replacing them. AI can enhance human cognitive capabilities by providing additional resources for problem-solving, decision-making, and information processing, rather than replacing human thought. The theory encourages a collaborative relationship between humans and AI, suggesting that technology can be integrated into cognitive processes to improve efficiency and creativity. Kantian ethics perspective introduced: only beings capable of moral reasoning can be held responsible, supporting human authorship.Only beings capable of moral reasoning, such as humans, can be held accountable for their actions, establishing a clear distinction between human authorship and machine output. Kantian ethics emphasizes the importance of intention and rationality in moral decision-making, reinforcing the idea that true authorship requires the ability to make ethical choices. This perspective supports the notion that while AI can assist in generating content, it lacks the moral reasoning necessary to claim authorship or responsibility for its outputs. Terminology debate emerged over 'ownership' vs 'authorship' - ownership deemed too authoritative and potentially problematic for future AI development. The distinction between 'ownership' and 'authorship' reflects differing views on the relationship between humans and AI, with 'ownership' suggesting control and authority over AI outputs. Concerns about 'ownership' arise from its implications for accountability and ethical considerations, particularly as AI systems become more autonomous.The preference for 'authorship' emphasizes the creative and intellectual contributions of humans in the development and use of AI, fostering a collaborative rather than a hierarchical relationship.",
          "- Pro-Machine Attribution: 'AI systems are independent enough to merit co-authorship or full attribution.'  Advanced cited MIT research showing decline in human critical thinking due to LLM usage, contradicting extended cognition theory. This finding challenges the extended cognition theory, which posits that tools like LLMs should enhance cognitive capabilities rather than diminish them. The research suggests that while LLMs can improve efficiency in tasks, they may inadvertently reduce the depth of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in individuals. Alfred argument that AI can be both a tool and have authorship, depending on the context in which it is used. He uses the analogy of a calculator to explain this nuance: AI can act as a tool (such as a calculator), but it can also be considered a 'creator' if its contribution is dominant.   Alfred pointed out as a tool: If AI only assists the process (e.g., finding research data), authorship remains with humans. As a 'creator': If the AI produces a complete work (e.g., a directly copy-pasted blog article), authorship should go to the AI. Gorga Said that AI has not been independent enough to be considered an author or given full attribution rights. While AI can help significantly, it lacks the autonomy, intention, and responsibility that are the basis of authorship. Therefore, the role of AI should be recognized as that of a tool, not an author. This maintains the integrity of authorship, while remaining transparent to AI contributions. In the future, this attitude may change as technology advances, but for now, authorship remains a human responsibility. Kizzy emphasized human adaptability and efficiency gains from tool usage throughout history, from abacus to modern calculators. The introduction of tools like the abacus and calculators has allowed individuals to perform complex tasks more quickly and accurately, reducing cognitive load. This evolution in tool usage reflects a broader trend where technology serves to augment human capabilities rather than replace them, fostering continuous learning and adaptation. Alfred proposed dual perspective: AI can be both tool and deserving of authorship depending on context and level of human involvement. Authorship may be attributed to AI when it generates content or solutions independently, especially in cases where minimal human input is involved, such as simple prompts or commands.The context of use is crucial; in complex tasks requiring significant human insight and decision-making, authorship remains with the human, while AI serves merely as a supportive tool."

          "Showcase: Ambassador Website Overview:   - Vsu presented the new Ambassador Program website https://ambassadors.singularitynet.io/ which launched approximately one week ago with SEO project already underway funded by R&D. The SingularityNet Ambassador Program website aims to serve as a hub for onboarding new ambassadors and sharing educational materials. An SEO project is currently in progress to enhance the website's visibility and organic traffic, leveraging insights from recent audits. Website audit revealed multiple issues including broken links, missing CSR links, and non-functional community forum links. Navigation buttons incorrectly labeled - 'Join the program' leads to about page while 'About the program' leads to Open Roles. Login/signup buttons redirect to Deep Funding website instead of Ambassador-specific functionality, causing confusion about program identity. causing confusion about program identity. Website appears designed more for Deep Funding ecosystem rather than existing Ambassador community members.",
          "Introduction to ASI1 LLM Framework : - Vasu introduces what is ASI1 LLM Framework. ASI LLM introduced as world's first Web3 native language model designed for Agentic AI, optimized for complex agent interactions. The ASI LLM is designed to facilitate complex interactions required by agent-based AI systems. It leverages a Web3 architecture, ensuring decentralized and community-driven development. SEO research assistant AI agent prototype created using ASI LLM framework for website optimization.",
          "Live Build: Agent #1 - SEO Researcher Assistant : - Osmium showed how the Ambassador Agent role works directly on the https://asi1.ai platform by demonstrating a live and functional SEO Researcher Assistant AI agent. The development of this agent was simplified through the Agent Wars platform built by Fetch AI, with API access from the SingularityNET AI Marketplace.  A custom SEO agent named 'SingularityNET Ambassador Program SEO Research Assistant' was developed with specific personas and responsibilities. This agent was designed to increase visibility and organic traffic to SingularityNET ambassador websites, with a focus on: keyword research, SEO content optimization, technical SEO insights, and backlink opportunities that align with the mission of the SingularityNET ecosystem. The AI Assistant targets a broad audience of developers, researchers, crypto enthusiasts, and AI advocates, with the aim of easing their onboarding and engagement in the ambassador program. The agent has been created and can be run directly on the site (actual agent).",
          "Ideation & Breakout: Other Agents for the Website : - Meeting members suggest how SEO content should be created, added, and improved on the Agent AI Ambassador Program that has been created at https://asi1.ai/. AI agent creation proposed for ASI app to help onboard new ambassadors and provide program information. The AI agent will facilitate onboarding by providing real-time answers to common questions from new ambassadors. It will integrate with existing systems to showcase available tasks and opportunities within the ambassador program. Success stories content strategy developed featuring regional guilds like Latam Guild and African Guild showcasing ambassador achievements. Blog content should focus on completed projects and measurable progress rather than ongoing work to motivate new participants. Governance content suggested including breakdown of contentious issues like anonymity and abstentions rather than fixed manifestos.",
          "Shareback: Agent Pitches. Onboarding AI agent concept discussed but requires further development in dedicated onboarding work group meeting. The onboarding AI agent concept aims to enhance user experience by providing tailored assistance during the onboarding process. Further development is needed to define the agent's persona and capabilities to effectively address user inquiries and guide them through the onboarding journey. Agent capabilities can be enhanced through AI Agent Voice platform with multiple agent integrations. Potential R&D proposal suggested for developing comprehensive onboarding AI agent with advanced capabilities."

          "We noted that this 12-month Catalyst proposal is not being submitted to the forthcoming hackathon. The hackathon will require a quick, working prototype in just a few days, and the team plans to use it as a way to build components, test ideas, and strengthen collaboration - lessons that will help shape a feasible strategy if the Catalyst proposal gets funded.   Peter highlighted the need to keep the hackathon work small-scale, while Colleen outlined how the platform would simplify cross-chain agent integration, and Vasu filled in technical background on embeddings, vector stores, and ICP infrastructure. Guillermo suggested treating the hackathon as a focused, simple MVP effort and brought up the Masumi project as a Cardano-based example to learn from.",
          "We discussed whether to keep ICP integration just for the hackathon or build it into the bigger plan, and touched on polishing the proposal's wording. Colleen admitted she probably couldn't take on development work for the hackathon this time because of technical setup challenges, though she still liked the ICP idea for the future.",

          "Ethical implications of granting decision making autonomy to artificial intelligence within governance and social systems: Vasu introduced concerns regarding ethical dimension, Can AI uphold fairness, transparency and accountability better than humans? Should AI follow strict ethical frameworks or evolve its own? Who is responsible when an AI-governed decision causes harm? Advanceameyaw argued that fairness, transparency, and accountability are inherently human duties rather than attributes that can be assigned to AI. Vasu supported this view, highlighting the importance of legitimate data and blockchain technology to ensure transparency in AI applications. Kateri noted that AI's judgment is influenced by the data it is fed, which can lead to biased outcomes.",
          "On governance & power:   should AI have advisory roles only, or actual voting/policy-making powers? Could AI reduce corruption and bias in governance, or amplify hidden biases? Risks of centralized AI control vs. decentralized AI governance.  Lordkizzy argued that accountability for the misuse of AI should fall on the individual user rather than the companies that create AI frameworks. Gorga disagreed, stating that the responsibility lies with the humans and institutions that design and implement AI governance. Vasu added that transparency in AI models is crucial to prevent misuse and suggested that making AI open source could address some concerns.  Vasu discussed the potential role of his 'EthosGuard' AI agent in governance, questioning whether such a system should be limited to providing policy recommendations or also empowered to make decisions. Advanceameyaw noted that the topic requires deeper contemplation, while Vasu emphasized the importance of recognizing the implications of AI's reliance on human-designed algorithms and data.  Lordkizzy questioned the accountability of search engines like Google in relation to the misuse of information, using the example of bomb-making. He emphasized that before the advent of AI, individuals could still access harmful information and that the responsibility lies with the user rather than the provider. He noted that AI makes information more widely accessible, and misuse is a possibility that should be acknowledged.",
          "Technological Feasibility:  How advanced must AI systems be before they are entrusted with governance roles? Can current LLMs or multi-agent systems reason deeply enough for governance-level decision-making? What safeguards (explainability, audit trails, failsafes) are necessary?  Kateri expressed apprehension about granting AI authority in decision-making, suggesting its role should remain limited, to reduce potential risks. Jeffrey emphasized that the benefits and drawbacks of AI ultimately depend on how it is applied.",

Exhibition sessions, covering two project showcases and administrative task support for community engagement.  c. Expert-led workshops, including follow-up activities with clear deliverable expectations.  d. Community engagement introduced for roundtable discussions and theoretical debates to motivate participant involvement.",
          "Vasu presented the workgroup's quarterly report for Q3 2025, including:  a. AI Sandbox/ Think-Tank integration successfully completed with dual focus approach combining practical agent development and governance considerations b. Agent build expansion achieved through catalog development, targeting three high-leverage roles tied to MASM website mission c. Governance-oriented debates conducted to inform requirements for ethics and governance advisor agent development d. Deep dive into ASI 1 LLM initiated, with practical application through development of an onboarding agent prototype e. SEO research assistant development progressed using ASI 1 LLM agent technology with R&D funding support from previous allocation f. EthosGuard framework completion, representing major governance milestone for autonomous agent ethics g. Community engagement metrics dmonstrated strong participation with an average of 14 participants per session",
          "Vasu started the discussion on the topic of his proposed 'AI agent civic framework - rights and duties for autonomous AI agents'.  He asked participants what an AI agent is, from their perspectives.  Gorga said that an AI agent is the smart contract integration approach favored by some participants who view AI agents as the brain layer behind smart contracts. Vasu sked whether Read.AI is an AI Agent and Gorga answered no, Read.AI is an AI tool.   Can tools like Read AI be categorized as agents or just simple automation services? Kateri said that an AI agent is like a computer program designed to make decisions or take actions to achieve specific goals. Peter added that an AI agent is processing something, so that you can ask something that can work with it and get different outputs back to you. This can also be applied to other agents.",
          "Vasu explained his framework of 4 levels of autonomy with specific capability definitions:  - Level 0: Inform and observe capabilities limited to data collection and reporting functions  - Level 1: Draft and propose functionality enabling recommendation generation and proposal creation - Level 2: Execute tasks with limits incorporating guard rails and bounded operational parameters - Level 3: Self-delegating and fully autonomous operation with minimal human oversight requirements  Participants discussed agent qualification criteria, highlighting the complexity of classification across different use cases. DeFi trading bots are recognized as clear agents with autonomous decision-making and execution capabilities. Research assistants are recognized for autonomous data processing and analysis capabilities with a reasoning component. Voice assistants are accepted as agents despite limitations in accent recognition and mixed interaction quality",
          "Rights and responsibilities framework development for AI agents:  Participants discussed the proposed agent rights structure including identity, operational freedom and communication protocols, and the proposed system of cryptographic identity requirements for unique agent identification and public registration. Various due process mechanisms are proposed through transparent appeals via a steward or DAO voting structure. and finally a guaranteed API channel for communication between agents is recommended for collaborative agent interaction and coordination.   For the agent duty framework, participants discussed the focus on transparency, accountability, and integration of human oversight. There is mandatory notification and provenance in AI agent tagging, along with model information requirements and accessible datasets. Proof of cryptographic action is proposed, including input/output hashes for complete traceability and verification. A human takeover mechanism is integrated through the supervisory DAO structure, ensuring appropriate control and intervention capabilities.",
          "Community AI agent experiences and use cases:  The participants discussed trading bot applications, which demonstrate the practical application of autonomous agents with varying performance results. Then there is the automation of crypto price monitoring achieved with the ability to execute entry and exit strategies. Accuracy limitations are acknowledged with occasional losses due to imperfect predictions and market volatility. Cardano blockchain integration was mentioned for DeFi farming strategies and specific yield optimization.  Participants noted that research and productivity applications show significant improvements in time efficiency with quality in mind. For example, the acceleration of academic research achieved through automated citation discovery and article discovery, the trade-off between quality and speed identified with AI assistance providing broader coverage but with a potential sacrifice in depth, and the quality of manual research is generally superior in terms of depth but is more time-consuming, requiring library access and extensive manual searching.  Participants also discussed voice assistant integrations - these help accessibility, but have technical limitations.  For example, successful Alexa implementations for basic automation including timers, scheduling and music control, accent recognition challenges that cause user experience friction requiring repeated commands and customization, and legacy chatbot experiences with SimSimi and customer support bots that provide historical context for agent evolution."

He outlined the meaning of some basic graph terminology: nodes (entities) and edges (relationships). He explained how conversion to a graph format allows a more network-like representation of data, which enables a different type of analysis. He has written using Python scripts to extract and manipulate data from the Archives' SQL database.",
          "Graph analysis and community detection in workgroup data:  Stephen discussed the analysis of a directed graph with about 1,800 nodes and 3,500 edges, and the identification of clusters and communities within the data. He used algorithms such as the Fuchter-Rheingold layout and Force Atlas 2 to visualize connections and discern patterns. The analysis indicated approximately 18 to 19 communities, which may represent various workgroups, and highlighted the potential for further statistical analysis to understand community influence and centrality.",
          "Ethical Considerations in AI Data Usage: Stephen Whitenstall discussed the ethical implications of using community-owned data in AI projects, stressing the necessity of obtaining consent and maintaining an audit trail. Vasu Madaan mentioned plans to implement these principles using Cardano's blockchain technology. The focus is on ensuring that the community understands how their data is being utilized.",
          "Exploring Data Analysis and Community Engagement: Stephen Whitenstall highlighted the goal of creating educational materials based on data analysis, suggesting that community input is crucial for understanding the significance of identified patterns. Vani emphasized the value of interactive sessions for deeper exploration of data insights, particularly regarding the influence of different work groups. They both acknowledged that the frequency of meetings does not necessarily equate to influence, as the weight of each meeting's impact varies.",
          "Discussion on Structured and Unstructured Data: Stephen Whitenstall explained that the data being discussed is primarily structured, allowing for a fixed hierarchical approach. He acknowledged the presence of unstructured data, as pointed out by Vani, and suggested that a separate focus would be necessary for analyzing this type of data. He proposed using methods like vectorization and semantic analysis to extract insights from unstructured data.",
          "Generative Data and AI Ethical Standards: Stephen Whitenstall highlighted the challenges of generative data, focusing on the necessity of grounding it to prevent misinterpretation. He advocated for applying AI ethical standards when developing tools like governance dashboards. Vasu Madaan mentioned the potential of using natural language data for analysis, although he noted delays in the high-prone approach. Both speakers acknowledged the importance of structured versus unstructured data in sentiment analysis.",
          "Data Structuring and Analysis in Governance Context Stephen Whitenstall emphasized the need to interpret data semantically, particularly when dealing with structured and unstructured data in governance contexts. Vani raised concerns about the consent process, noting that while data fields appear structured, responses can often be unstructured and unclear. This discrepancy complicates the analysis and understanding of objections."

Narrow AI: Artificial Intelligence that is limited to a single domain. It cannot perform complex, multi-domain reasoning but is designed to handle specific tasks effectively. Examples include chatbots (like ChatGPT), large language models (LLMs), image recognition systems, video generating platform (imvideo) and voice assistants (such as Siri and Alexa).  Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): A human-level form of AI that can understand, learn, reason, and make decisions across multiple domains, not just a single task. Unlike Narrow AI, AGI would be capable of performing a wide range of tasks and adapting to new challenges, much like a human mind. Example: a single AI system that can carry out all required tasks at once from problem-solving to communication to creative work.  Artificial Superintelligence (ASI): A stage of AI where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence in reasoning, creativity, problem-solving, and even emotional understanding. At this point, AI would not only think faster and more accurately than humans but also demonstrate capabilities far beyond our comprehension. It represents an 'out-of-this-world' level of advancement, where AI becomes more intelligent than the best human minds in virtually every field.",
          "Back to today's discussion: When should we see AI as not just a tool, but start recognizing it as a collaborator? Collaboration between humans and AI emerged as a key theme, with participants debating the nature of such partnerships given AI's lack of consciousness. Jeffreystressed the importance of verifying AI-generated outputs to ensure reliability. Kateri highlighted that collaboration with AI is already used into daily tasks, making it less of a future concept and more of a present reality. Max Milez added depth by noting the complexities of defining collaboration, especially since AI's backend processes make it difficult to clearly separate tool use from true partnership (He discussed his struggles with AI tools, specifically mentioning a day spent trying to use chat GPT for a video project. He noted that the AI often provided names without links, necessitating further searches on platforms like inVideo. Milez expressed that once AGI is achieved, it should function like Google, providing comprehensive access to information from a single application.",
          "Addressing Over-Reliance on AI in Education: Lord Kizzy expressed concerns about the growing reliance on AI in education, noting that students often generate answers through AI tools without first engaging their own reasoning. He compared current practices to earlier stages of education, where learning advanced more gradually and students-built knowledge step by step.  UknowZork added to this concern by highlighting the negative impact of excessive technology use in schools, arguing that it undermines the development of foundational learning skills. She recalled her own educational experience, where calculators and other technological aids were rarely used, and students had to build problem-solving abilities independently. UknowZork suggested that schools establish clear boundaries for the use of AI, encouraging students to first seek answers from traditional resources such as textbooks and libraries before turning to AI tools. Lord Kizzy emphasized the need to strike a balance between collaboration with AI and over-dependence on it.",
          "AI tool Exhibition Overview and Template Introduction: Lord Kizzy outlined the purpose of the AI tools Exhibition, which serves as a platform for members to showcase AI tools that can enhance the Ambassador Program. He highlighted the use of a standardized template for presentations and encouraged participants to review previous exhibitions for guidance.   It was noted that, due to budget restrictions, the AI tool exhibition had been paused for a period. However, despite the limited resources, the initiative is being revived and relaunched, signaling a renewed focus on integrating AI tools into the program.   The meeting ended with Lord Kizzy further asking if anyone was interested in taking up the presentation slot, but no one responded at the time. He mentioned that he would reach out to Advance or Gorga to invite them to present at the next meeting. If they are unavailable, he committed to delivering the presentation himself."

          "AI Sandbox/Think-tank Introduction The meeting began with LordKizzy welcoming attendees.  Content Optimization Strategy Review:  LordKizzy presented a comprehensive analysis of content performance across Medium and YouTube platforms, highlighting key findings and recommendations for SEO optimization. The team identified priority hashtags and high-value keywords for better SEO, such as 'AI,' 'SingularityNet,' and 'AGI,' and suggested implementing a minimum of 5-7 hashtags per article. For YouTube, they noted a significant performance gap between top AGI content and their own, recommending changes to video titles, the inclusion of expert names, and the use of high-performing keywords. LordKizzy shared a 30-day implementation plan to improve content optimization and suggested updating the Ambassador Program Town Hall titles to include specific keywords and expert names. The team also created a handbook to guide content posting improvements and shared insights with social media managers for further implementation.",
          "Social Media Data Analysis Challenges:  Osmium discussed data collection and analysis challenges across various social media platforms, including YouTube and Medium. They explained that manual audits and custom tools were needed due to inconsistent data availability and poor UI, with specific issues noted around profile pictures and banners. The discussion concluded with a suggestion from Advanceameyaw to develop a centralized AI tool that could automatically pull and analyze analytics from multiple platforms, which Ambassadors acknowledged as a potential future improvement.",
          "Social Media Dashboard Proposal:  Osmium proposed creating a new social media dashboard tool for the marketing team, building upon previous work done by Rojo that was not completed. The team discussed the need for dedicated developer support to successfully roll out the AI sandbox mode and considered the possibility of collaborating with Deepfunding.",
          "Exploring Partnership and Collaboration:  The team discussed extending their current project to include deepfunding initiatives, and explored potential collaborations with developers. LordKizzy mentioned reaching out to Ubio Obu (Deepfunding Developeer Outreach Circle) through Osmium to initiate a partnership, despite challenges posed by token price fluctuations. Advanceameyaw suggested defining the specific type of collaboration or partnership they aim to establish, emphasizing the need for clarity on what services or tools would be involved. He also proposed creating a document outlining the partnership goals to facilitate discussions."

Vasu asked who is going to the Dework admin task. Slate noted that the conversation will be held separately from the meeting.

          "There was a brief discussion about the low meeting attendance. Ese asked if the shift to biweekly meetings was the cause. Slate noted that attendance may have dropped due to the change in administrative focus-many only attend meetings when they are directly involved in decision-making. Kateri agreed, adding that there's also been confusion around meeting dates due to the biweekly schedule. She pointed out that this miscommunication is affecting the guild. Given the budget constraints, she suggested that perhaps meeting announcements should be made at least a week in advance. Gorga supported the idea.",

LordKizzy reported that he has created a slide for the presentation. The remaining part is for Vani to complete. Although there's no strict deadline, the project is expected to be completed within the quarter. Slate asked whether Kizzy was developing presentation materials, and Kizzy confirmed that the slides focus on in-depth governance models. The series will consist of 8 sessions followed by a sprint in which participants answer questions based on previous governance sessions.",
          "Gorga shared a Web development presentation he presented in the Gamers Guild. He explained that the idea was to repurpose it into a web development glossary for the ambassador program. It would resemble a GitBook but would focus solely on education and onboarding content. Slate also added that he has built a Wiki website for DeepFunding and proposed that the Education Guild could adopt a similar approach. The wiki could house the glossary section and include a voting tool. He mentioned he would check with Guillermo about the possibility of integrating the skills database into the platform. Gorga asked if the CCCP program could also be integrated, and Slate responded that he could manage that, though he would take the lead on the development. Ese and the group supported Slate's idea, noting that a centralized wiki platform would make the program appear more organized. She asked if it could be created at no cost, considering the guild's limited budget. Slate replied that the wiki site itself could be created for free, but integrating the glossary might require some budget.",
          "The meeting concluded with Ese emphasizing the importance of follow-up and accountability for all individuals handling projects this quarter. She stressed that timely submissions are critical to ensuring that the guild meets its quarterly metrics and goals."

          "ASI Academy Proposal  The idea of an 'ASI Academy' was introduced primarily by Osmium, based on an original proposal by David Taylor, former Chief Marketing Officer at Cardano. Osmium emphasized that the academy should be more than a general course - it should be a strategic, ecosystem-aligned educational platform for the ASI alliance (SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol). He suggested using the Cardano Academy as a case study, drawing parallels to successful educational systems in decentralized ecosystems. The ASI Academy could integrate lessons and structures from CCP, AI for Beginners, and previous Ambassador projects, with a more refined focus on decentralized AI and internal technologies like ASI Cloud, ASI Infrastructure, and spin-offs. The discussion highlighted the need for a dedicated course that aligns with SingularityNET's evolving direction. everyone supported the idea, and a working group will be formed for this.",
          "Governance Webinars Update  Osmium provided a comprehensive update on the governance education series. The team now has two presentations developed - an expansion from the original single presentation model. The governance module has faced delays due to evolving governance systems, which could create confusion among participants if rolled out prematurely. To address this, Osmium shared that the structure now includes a series of five webinars, one of which will be an interactive Mentimeter workshop, and another focusing on decision-making tools and methodologies. A complete blueprint document is being prepared to outline the roadmap, and announcements for the webinars will be released soon. Osmium encouraged participants to refer to the document to understand the updated structure and educational goals.",
          "CCCP Extension Progress  Gorga led the update on the CCCP (Core Contributor Certification Program) extension. He created a spreadsheet assigning tasks to content creators and assessors, which he shared in the chat. One of the key issues raised was the limited number of content creators compared to the volume of work, leading to Lord Kizzy being assigned two spin-off video tasks. Osmium requested to take over the Sentience video from Kizzy, subject to Kizzy's approval. Gorga was open to the reassignment, but emphasized the need for proper agreement. There was also some confusion regarding which spin-offs are active or already documented. A final decision was made to replace the ASI general video with Sentience.",
          "AI Intermediate Course Proposal  Building on the AI for Beginners course, Osmium proposed the creation of a follow-up course, possibly titled AI Intermediate or Foundations. This initiative aims to transition from broad, entry-level AI education to SingularityNET-aligned content focused on the ASI ecosystem. Osmium noted that the prior course didn't generate sustained engagement from external audiences, and therefore the next phase should target the existing loyal community. He suggested reviewing the feedback from the AI for Beginners course to inform future content and structure. The topics are to include current ecosystem priorities such as ASI infrastructure, ASI Cloud, and decentralized AI practices. Gorga and others agreed to carry the idea forward into next quarter's proposal planning.",
          "Website Options for ASI Academy  The need for a dedicated website to host ASI Academy content sparked a thoughtful discussion between Osmium and Gorga. They explored three options: 1) building on Slate's existing LMS-style platform, 2) expanding the Ambassador Wiki site, and 3) integrating directly into the SingularityNET Ambassador Program site. Osmium advised that no web development should start until they have confirmed alignment with the Foundation, to avoid redundant efforts like in previous site-building attempts. Once foundational support is secured, the working group will draft a blueprint and roadmap outlining site architecture, content flow, and integration strategies. Osmium also considered involving David Taylor as an advisor, given his original vision for the academy and experience in educational platform development."

          "Budget Allocation & Contingency The group revisited CCP funding allocations. It was clarified that allocations had already been made in Q2, with reserves covering extensions. While some members questioned whether new funds were required, the consensus was to reassign tasks to active contributors and avoid additional funding requests unless strictly necessary. Kary introduced a contingency line item in the budget (~$100) to account for operational costs and unforeseen delays. Members agreed the exact amount should be based on concrete needs rather than guesses.",
          "Task Reassignments & CCP Content Progress Due to inactivity of some contributors, tasks will be reassigned to ensure steady progress. Updates included: Infographic and video creation tasks are ongoing, with several completed or near completion. Frosh's infographic needs minor revisions (adding a missing element). Some members reduced from multiple tasks to one. Certain projects lacked sufficient material to proceed with video creation. Overall, four main projects are moving forward, with continued tracking in the CCP task sheet.",
          "Governance Webinars Update Osmium shared progress on the governance webinar series, noting that multiple slide decks have been prepared. The rollout has been delayed due to ongoing governance changes, to avoid confusing participants. The updated plan includes a structured webinar series supported by presentations, with future integration into educational dashboards or UI/UX improvements for accessibility. Members were asked to review the slides and provide feedback.",
          "Criteria & Selection Concerns Questions were raised about criteria used for selecting content creators and assessors. It was clarified that selections were based on submitted best work (infographics, videos), independently graded by assessors, and then consolidated into a group decision. Concerns about fairness and transparency were acknowledged, but time constraints limited extended discussion.",
          "Meeting Facilitation & Documentation The group humorously debated who hosted the meeting, eventually concluding it was a collective effort. Documentation responsibilities were rotated, with a reminder to archive and circulate the meeting notes."

The primary objection concerns the relatively high percentage of budget spent on administrative activities compared to operational workgroups.

Several members confirmed that while no formal vote occurred, the group had previously reached consent to proceed with Osmium's proposal as the quarter's project, with no objections raised at the time. The misunderstanding stemmed from differing recollections of the previous meeting and documentation.",
          "Budget and consent process:  reminders that any major budget changes exceeding 5% would require a budget change request involving the wider community. Osmium explained the ASI Academy's structure, its phases, and deliverables, including educational materials, videos, and a detailed roadmap. He also clarified that while he would consult with the ASI Foundation for guidance, the Education Guild would still be responsible for developing and executing the project's content. Goga and others emphasized the need for transparency on which parts of the project Education Guild members could contribute to, prompting Osmium to promise a blueprint and workflow for review at the next meeting.",

Peter led the discussion, outlining plans to refine the survey and reduce administrative workload. Vani raised concerns about survey fatigue, suggesting that workgroups skip budget submissions for the current quarter and instead submit expenditure and progress reports. This, she explained, would allow for a more thorough and meaningful sentiment survey.  Peter explained that the 80/20 rule serves as a safeguard, encouraging participation while ensuring that a single person can prevent a workgroup from reaching consent. He noted, however, that in practice, it often leads to situations where contributors fail to participate consistently, leaving active contributors to constantly remind and encourage them to engage even without proper oversight.  He suggested that while simplifying processes is a positive step, but we should be cautious not to introduce too many changes at once, as this could lead to confusion. Vani added that all the proposed adjustments could be discussed further in Quarter One, and for the current quarter, the group would simply announce that there will be no consent process.  The group agreed that one week would be sufficient for participants to complete the sentiment survey, which is scheduled to be released on November 7th. Vani suggested that it would be ideal to complete the analysis before Christmas, allowing enough time to review the results and integrate feedback into Q1 planning.  A question was also raised about the survey structure whether to keep it short and simple or include multiple detailed questions to capture more information feedback.  The draft survey was shared during the call, and members provided their suggestions and edits to improve the clarity and focus of the questions.  To conclude, Peter clarified that the feedback collected from the sentiment survey will not impact the budget capS",

          "Presentation of ASI Create by Gorga  Gorga presented the ASI Create module he developed as part of the ASI Academy's ongoing efforts. He shared slides and documents, walking participants through the structure and content of ASI Create. The module includes a comprehensive introduction to the ASI Creation Framework, focusing on its role as a bridge between AI developers and users. Key innovations outlined included decentralized AI compute, development infrastructure, and multi-agent protocols. He explained ASI Create's integration with the broader ASI DePIN stack, emphasizing its four pillars: enhanced large language models, neural-symbolic systems, work models, and agent networks. The slides also detailed toolkits such as the AI Launchpad, cross-domain GenAI, developer spaces, pre-trained AI agents, and domain-specific applications in crypto trading and biotech. Gorga encouraged everyone to review the shared material and provide feedback. Zalfred and Peter both praised the structure and potential impact of the module, though Peter advised delaying public release until official ASI product roadmaps are published for better alignment. He also mentioned to remove Ocean Protocol as they exited the alliance.",
          "Pending Updates from Other Contributors  Zalfred reviewed the core assignments and noted that Kateri, Osmium, Lord Kizzy, Ese and Martinsoki were all assigned different ASI Academy modules (Train, Learn, Compute, Data, Zero) but were absent. He expressed concern that only Gorga had delivered a module update, and committed to reaching out to each of the others post-meeting to track their progress and provide a status update to the group.",
          "Governance Webinar Series  When asked about progress on the Governance Series, Gorga confirmed that this was being handled by Osmium and Lord Kizzy, but both were absent from the call. Zalfred stated that he would follow up with them via chat or group message to confirm updates, including the latest on the deliverables, budget, architecture, and rollout timeline that Osmium had reportedly shared in a prior meeting.",
          "Quarterly Report for Q4 2025  The Q4 report was briefly discussed. Zalfred will ask SirXalfred again about volunteering; if there's no response, Zalfred will take over. He invited others to contribute or take over the report by messaging him in the group.",
          "Next Steps for ASI Academy Modules and Reporting  Zalfred highlighted the need to move forward with collecting all remaining module presentations from the contributors. He restated the importance of getting a clear overview before the next quarter begins and noted that this will help the guild prepare for 2026 planning. A list of individuals (Kateri, Osmium, Kizzy, Ese Williams, and Martinsoki) was mentioned as priority contacts for follow-up. He confirmed that the ASI Academy and Governance Series updates will remain key focus areas moving forward.",
          "Zalfred also said he will reach out to Slate to get updates on CCCP because he was absent in the meeting."

          "Slate presented a live demo of the JamGalaxy AI Synthesizer, explaining how the team overcame Roblox API restrictions by saving generated music files in Google Drive and then accessing them in-game. The demo included gameplay that allowed players to interact with and be scored on their generated music, while also displaying JamGalaxy's branding and linking to the SingularityNET Marketplace. This was shared as a model of how third-party services can be embedded into Guild experiences.",
          "The AI Comics proposal, introduced by Slate, focused on creating visual story-driven comics to explain complex SNET concepts such as reputation systems, decentralized identity, or governance in an engaging way. Osmium contributed ideas based on past collaboration with Mindplex, emphasizing the potential of AI comic tools and referring to 'Desdemona's Dream' as a successful example of narrative-rich, visually appealing work. The group debated different tools like Canva versus custom animation or illustration styles and agreed that a prototype would strengthen a future RFP submission.",
          "In discussing the Gamified Portal, Slate shared a functioning prototype created using Google App Script, showing how tools and quests could be linked to XP systems and user progress. Kizzy raised concerns about email-based login due to privacy issues and recommended using Discord authentication instead. Osmium offered gamified UI templates and encouraged a shift to React or other modern platforms. Members supported using the system not only for tool promotion but also for educational training.",
          "The third idea was the Visual Glossary, an educational tool similar to W3Schools, where users could interactively explore terms and concepts related to the Ambassador Program. Slate explained that this glossary would include visual demonstrations for each term and potentially interactive simulations. However, Kizzy and Osmium expressed that this initiative might be better aligned with the Onboarding or R&D Guilds due to its educational nature. A debate emerged on whether the glossary could be considered truly 'gamified,' and while Slate defended its interactive and visual elements as qualifying, Osmimum felt it lacked the core game mechanics like scoring or progression. Ultimately, it was agreed that this project could originate from Gamers Guild but should be executed in collaboration with R&D, AI sandbox, or Onboarding WG to ensure proper alignment and access to technical resources.",
          "Rebel showed recent work on the R&D Guild department in-game, including new logos and UI elements. However, issues remained with unanchored models, a non-functional narrator tool, and confusion over the intended purpose of the 'social media' room. Kizzy clarified that what was labeled as a 'social media room' was actually meant to showcase a social media automation tool, not social platforms themselves, and suggested correcting the naming. There was also a recommendation to replace the 'Entity Connection' room with content from the Governance Dashboard.",
          "Slate confirmed that asset creation was open again and requested that Kizzy and others mentor new members. They will be assigned departments and guided through tasks like animation. The team discussed available departments (e.g., Sandbox, Regional Communities) for upcoming map development and agreed to form a dedicated mentorship group to support new contributors effectively.",
          "There was discussion about returning to biweekly meetings instead of monthly ones. Rebel noted that monthly cycles slowed momentum and delayed progress updates. Everyone agreed that biweekly meetings would help maintain a better rhythm and ensure faster iteration across projects."

          "Gamified Portal Demo and Technical Overview  Slate opened the session by demonstrating the working prototype of the Gamified Ambassador Portal. The portal includes a login system, user XP tracking, guild-specific quests, and an admin panel. It is currently built on a Next.js frontend and uses Google Sheets as a backend. However, due to Google quota limitations, there was a discussion about shifting the backend to a proper database (possibly Supabase or Firebase). The design takes inspiration from Zilly and aims to create an immersive dashboard for contributors, while also enabling automation of XP systems and portal functionality.",
          "AI-Generated Comic Initiative  Initiative to develop AI-generated comics that explain SingularityNET's projects and tools was discussed. Slate, Kizzy, and Osmium discussed using characters like Desdemona and Sophia to narrate stories in comic format. Tools like MidJourney for visuals, Google's AI animator, Hexfield, and Banana Model were suggested. These comics could be used to educate users in an entertaining way. The group agreed this could be a candidate for the DeepFunding Round 5 RFP ideation track, and Osmium offered to create a workflow demo to illustrate the comic creation pipeline.",
          "Writers Workgroup Animation Debugging  Lord kizzy mentioned the malfunctioning NPC animations in the Writers Workgroup department of the Roblox world. New animations prepared for characters like Devon were not playing correctly, even after republishing. It was concluded that the problem might be due to improper asset linking or format inconsistencies. To resolve this, the team agreed to test and reuse working animations from the Video Workgroup. Kizzy was tasked with copying and testing these working animation assets.",
          "Visual Enhancements to R&D Guild Areas  Rebel showcased improvements to the R&D Workgroup's rooms, including updated visuals for the Social Media Automation Tool (also correcting its name) and a more informative Governance Dashboard. The Governance section now includes a dynamic token price chart and upcoming AGIX votes UI, increasing interactivity and educational value. There were further plans to display token usage and past voting history within the portal. These upgrades aim to make the Roblox space not just visually appealing but also functionally informative.",
          "Team Expansion and Mentorship  The group discussed onboarding new memebers and assigning clear mentorship tasks. Slate committed to sharing a list of outstanding dev tasks and requirements to aid recruitment. Kizzy proposed bringing on a new member who showed promise in prior testing."

He showcased the prototype of the Visual Glossary, explaining how it demonstrates terms like 'XP System' and 'Quest System' using animated visuals. The glossary is intended to educate users through interaction and UI animations.",
          "Visual Glossary Budget Breakdown and Development Approaches:  The budget request for the glossary is $300, covering UI, animation, glossary entries, and interactivity. Slate described two implementation options:  Option 1: Gamers Guild selects glossary terms, builds animations (Canva/GIFs), and adds entries manually.  Option 2: Launch a form/survey to gather term suggestions from guilds and use those inputs to prioritize entries. A consensus was formed to use both methods, starting with a curated set and expanding via community submissions. The goal: 10 entries with animations by end of quarter.  A separate line item was proposed for glossary icons and gamified UI assets, mainly to allow flexible use of funds and clearer budget categorization. This item is part of the visual glossary development stream.",

Users complete quests, explore tools, and earn XP; admins from each guild can manage tools, quests, and review submissions via their dashboard. He suggested that the Visual Glossary could either be:  Integrated directly into this portal,  Kept separate,  Or handed to the Education Guild for wiki integration.  The budget request for this was $450, covering front-end, back-end, testing, UI polishing, and community feedback handling.",

          "Retrospective was also collected asynchronously on the Miro board, the zoom meeting chat, and the ongoing feedback form-Retrospective questions on what went well, what didn't, impact, and next focus. What went well: The onboarding process was highlighted as a major success. New members reported the overview document provided 'exceptional clarity' and was 'instrumental' to their integration, even serving as a benchmark that could improve the main Ambassador Program onboarding. The use of the Miro board was praised for making work organized and explainable. The feedback form effectively created recurring interest, and everyone contributed at least a little each meeting. What didn't go well: Key challenges included low usage of GitBook outputs by general members, who primarily rely on Discord or each other for information. Participation remained inconsistent, and distributing/picking up tasks was still complicated. Formatting assets in Miro was confusing for new members despite guides, suggesting the process might be overly complex ('micro-managing'). The move to a monthly schedule reduced communication and led to missed meetings due to unclear scheduling. Our Impact (Output vs. Outcome): The outcome was a more cohesive and learning-focused team. Impacts included learning to use AI in the organization process, improving logical thinking via GPT, and sharing methodologies (like with the ODIN network). Quantitatively, adding 2+ active contributors was a positive improvement. Decision-Making Process: The process was deemed a success because it was decentralized, fair, and highly accessible to new members, making them feel included and able to contribute immediately. Feedback Insights: A review of Town Hall feedback and survey results confirmed that while members are aware of the GitBook, they haven't found a reason to use it, preferring Discord and direct communication as their primary information sources."

The development of an onboarding tool for new members was proposed, and collaboration with other guilds in education and gamification was emphasized. The reactivation of communication spaces was planned starting in March, with a focus on attracting more participants from Colombia and prioritizing the incorporation of members from Bolivia and Mexico.",

Eric Davies confirmed Malik attendance metrics, Ese walked the Guild project management board on GitHub to enhance task submissions and updates. Photogee and LordKizzy discussed upcoming initiatives, including the podcast and collaborations of Zealy with other workgroups, with a timeline set for a three-week sprint starting February 4. The purpose of the meeting was to emphasize the importance of aligning all members on their tasks and responsibilities.",
          "Discussion on Discord Channel Structure: Ese Williams opened a discussion on the relevance of the current Discord channels considering the structural change in the Guild. Ayo led the conversation, and different members - LordKizzy and Kenichi - opted for a suggestion to merge the channels. There was an agreement to have one open channel for general discussions and another closed channel for activities, operations,initiatives, and information sharing.",
          "Discussion on Governance Document and Initiatives: Ayo updated the status of the Governance document, informing that Kareem was absent from the previous meetings. Lordkizzy noted the need to merge the two current governance documents. Ayo confirmed that Ese was going to take on the task for the documentation. The social media channel in Discord was also brought up, and he confirmed all representatives had been added.",
          "Discussion on Merging Creative and Marketing Design Teams: Kareem outlined an initiative focused on a comic project that promotes SingularityNet, suggesting a merger between the creative team and the marketing design group. He emphasized that combining these teams would reduce redundancy in design tasks and allow for better resource allocation. Ayo was confused about the overlapping between the two groups and sought clarification on how the merger would benefit both. Ayo led the discussion on merging the two entities, emphasizing the need for proper documentation for ease of comprehension. Kenichi added that the design team needed clarification on the process and that finding similarities between marketing efforts and the comic series needed to be established. LordKizzy inquired about the budget structure for the merger, prompting Ayo to request Kareem's commitment to prepare documentation for the next meeting.",
          "Discussion on the New Event Role and Responsibilities: Ayo initiated a discussion about the new event role, He emphasized that there should be clear expectations from Cj Frankie on what is to be done. Kenichi explained that his original concept for the role involved a collaborative effort across the marketing guild, rather than it being solely the responsibility of one individual. He also mentioned having extensive documentation to support this initiative.",
          "Kelvin Wallet Issues Discussion: Ayo mentioned the issue of the missing 100 AGIX, which the receiver transferred to an inaccessible wallet. Kenichi noted this was not the first time the participant had encountered this problem; this shows irresponsibility on the part of the participant for failure to update the wallet. Malik supported the motion that the participant is responsible for providing the correct wallet address.",
          "Discussion on Attendance and Task Allocation in Marketing Guild: Ayo brought up Kenichi's absence from the November 15 meeting, which Kenichi attributed to attending the PIU event in Unilag. He stated that he had previously informed the team about his unavailability and discussed collaboration opportunities with other guilds. Ayo proposed checking meeting notes to confirm the details of Kenichi's communications regarding the event. EseWilliams discussed the importance of confirming Kenichi attendance at events as an ambassador for SingularityNet, which could impact his role within the organization. Ayo O mentioned that verifying Kenichi's absence would help determine future actions, while also questioning the claim that the Marketing Guild was supposed to fund 50% of an initiative.",
          "Critical Assessment and Restructuring of the Marketing Guild: Lordkizzy highlighted the difficulties encountered by the marketing guild, particularly the lack of participation from core team members in essential meetings. He pointed out that despite multiple discussions, decisions could not be made due to insufficient attendance, leading to a reassessment of roles and responsibilities. The restructuring was deemed necessary to address these issues and improve overall commitment."

Ayo addressed Kenichi's concerns about his attendance record and potential demotion due to not communicating with the Guild about his absence in the meeting in order to participate in the event which took place on November 15th 2024. The background to all of this is that core members ought to attend meetings because it is a  compulsory criteria in maintaining your role as a core member (at least 70% attendance ) and if for any reason you will be absent you are required to inform the Guild ahead of time.",

          "Projects management: We went through the project management board and addressed all pending tasks one after the other.  LordKizzy raised an opportunity for community members to bring their initiative to R&D Workgroup channel and submit their proposal so it can go into review and might get funded.",
          "A.O.B:  Design Workgroup under marketing guild: Kareem noted that the way Graphics designers function is not the best for content deliverables. He noted that this initiative helps define their role, help us with templates creation, and helps to structure all graphics. Ayo asked why can't the proposal not be done by the core members in the guild? Kareem responded that the idea is to make sure that structure is implemented. Ayo brought up a suggestion that all the graphics team members in the guild should have a call and discuss this proposal. He asked what is the difference between this budget attached to this structure and the present guild budget for graphics team members. Ayo suggested that we need to properly consider the initiative presented, consider it alongside the governance document, consider the output, consider the increment in the budget that goes to the graphics team and so on. He went on and urge members to go through the documents both governance document and the initiative document so we can discuss about the implementation next meeting. LordKizzy suggested that in terms so budgeting if the initiative can correlate with the current allocation that we have for graphics design it will be very feasible because we are currently having a huge budget constraints. Kareem noted that the budget proposed is to guide the workflow and if the guild isn't able to fund all it means something will not be done.    Podcast Initiatives and Marketing Guild Concerns: Photogee made a comment about the initiative team of the podcast initiative,he noted that they are some criterias for the podcast team to meet in order to keep the ground running. He noted that education guild has a webinar series coming up and it is similar to what we are trying to achieve, stating that it might limit us to many things.  He went further and raised a concern about the voting process of the marketing guild. He noted that he feels there is a loophole and it is the fact that we vote during the meetings, he proposed that if we want to make a smart decision we should make the decision in our locked channel not on the call because it gives changes for anybody not in the guild to vote. Ayo made a comment that he agrees that decisions are to be made by only Marketing guild members i.e people that are dedicated and committed to the guild. He noted that our guild is a very interesting guild and that is why at the beginning we decided that the guild call is a must to attend and if you can't attend make sure you have a good reason and make sure you announce it because decision are to be made during the call and people that are not dedicated to the meeting are not valid to made a decision on the guild they don't value. However, he noted that we should also see what the governance document says about the decision making. But he noted that the majority who are committed are the majority that should get to decide. LordKizzy noted that on a normal basis if a document is posted on the channel people don't give feedback on the channel and they come back during the meeting to starting asking questions. He noted that if decision are making during the meeting   Social media engagement: Photogee noted that we have a very poor engagement on our social media platforms and noted that this concern has been raised before, and if we engage on our social media post ourselves others will follow up.  Monthly analysis of marketing guild budget: Photogee noted that LordKizzy owes it to the guild to create a monthly report of very money that is spent so that we would know keep track of our expenses and reserve."

          "Discussion on Governance Doc: Ayo asked Martinsoki why the governance document link wasn't in the summary, and Martinsoki said he couldn't find it. Ayo then asked Ese to send the link.  Ayo asked if anyone had reviewed the governance document, emphasizing that discussing it without prior review was pointless. Kareem responded that, aside from Kenichi's document merger, everyone had seen it before. Ayo pointed out that Kareem was involved in creating it, so he was already familiar with it. Ese added that Ayo should have seen it too since no changes were made to the document.  Ese presented the governance document, outlining its focus on the Guild's operations and decision-making framework-key challenges affecting attendance, task completion, metric evaluation, payments, and compensation. The document addresses decision-making issues, including who participates, the required quorum, and the overall process. For more details visit 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yuVkAdkXA2R4QbLaCZQvWipaB83PAogQWnLR5hwD9ZE/edit?tab=t.0'.  Photogee raised concerns about decision-making, suggesting that while Zoom calls allow discussions, final decisions should be based on Discord polls for better engagement. He noted that if only 30% of members vote, the decision could be invalid. Ayo asked if a locked channel was meant to prevent uninformed voting. Photogee clarified that key decisions should be made by the core team and task force members, as they manage the guild. Kenichi supported voting on Discord, arguing it ensures transparency and a recorded history, unlike one-time decisions made on Zoom.",
          "Discussion on March Issues: Ayo asked Ese regarding the GitHub board if it's too early to start discussing March issues. Ese responded that the issues for March are yet to be out.",
          "A.O.B: TheFreysDefi proposed creating a direct pipeline from marketing to MindPlex to enhance mobility and visibility within the ecosystem. He suggested reinstating an overarching guild, possibly called the MindPlex Guild, to unify all three guilds. Ayo acknowledged the idea but emphasized that the current focus is on discussing the governance document, as it is essential for progress."

Gorga explained the graphics team's non-hierarchical structure, while Ayo emphasized the need for all members to review the governance document before the next meeting, setting a 70% review benchmark for effective decision-making.

LordKizzy also noted that a proposal for increased funding for podcast was rejected.",

Eric provided an update on the podcast initiative, indicating that it was initially set to start on Sunday but will now commence next week due to technical issues.",

          "Marketing Initiatives and Quarterly Reports: LordKizzy presented the quarterly marketing report focused on raising SingularityNET awareness within budget limits, proposed shifting meetings to a bi-weekly schedule due to compensation concerns, and suggested evaluating team output for fairer rewards while supporting equal allocation to prevent conflict; he stressed the need to finalize the proposed structure to avoid budget confusion, while Kareem emphasized the urgency of submitting the Q3 budget and called for more discussion on the in-house marketing setup; Peter E argued that equal rewards may not reflect individual effort and suggested balancing responsibilities, Kenichi proposed submitting the Q3 report as is due to time constraints with room for future adjustments, and new budget change guidelines now require core contributor consent."

          "Q3 Budget Discussion: LordKizzy presented two Q3 proposals: one maintains the current guild structure with payments shifted to AGIX (150 AGX/month for core members, 100 AGX for Task Force), while the other restructures the guild into Operations (30%) and Initiatives (70%), with defined AGIX caps and responsibilities. A discussion followed on finalizing Q3 strategies, with Ese Williams emphasizing the need to focus on fewer, more executable initiatives and reduce meeting frequency to manage workload. Ayo supported moving to bi-weekly meetings, citing low compensation for facilitation and documentation, though others voiced concerns about uneven impact across roles. Debates emerged about AGIX price volatility, documentation quality, and internal collaboration challenges. Kareem criticized Ayo's facilitation style, urging more constructive dialogue and suggesting AI support for documentation. LordKizzy stressed the importance of reducing workload, improving human-led documentation, and maintaining team cohesion. Ese urged the guild to prioritize clear decision-making over assigning blame, while LordKizzy emphasized the need for ongoing financial discussions to support sustainable projects. Ayo reinforced the importance of collaboration and mutual trust to effectively navigate the guild's current challenges. No decision was made as regards to the distribution for Q3."

          "Budget Updates and Budget Consent: LordKizzy provided insights into the budget, expressing concerns about the Guild's unclear goals and the lack of evidence demonstrating positive outcomes from their initiatives. He emphasized the need for measurable results and a clear strategy for Q3, including collaboration among workgroups to enhance outreach. He also presented Social media analytics showing strong growth in their overall Social media accounts through the Zealy initiative, indicating the effectiveness of recent marketing efforts. Ayo emphasized the need to distinguish between valid and invalid objections to address concerns constructively, urging members to be specific. In response, Photogee clarified that while he acknowledged the presence of both valid and invalid objections. Ayo emphasized the urgency of addressing objections related to the Marketing Guild and urged participants to prioritize the topic. He opposed suggestions to reallocate guild reserves and argued that evaluation should be based on outputs rather than subjective outcomes. Ayo also called for clarity on the guild's target audience, LordKizzy emphasized that our target audience are not just within the ambassadorial program, but outside the ambassadorial program. And that was our key focus on using the Zealy sprint. Ayo stressed the importance of broader member participation in the Governance call to avoid over-reliance on LordKizzy for representation.  Mikasa expressed frustration over criticisms of the guild's efforts, advocating for a focus on quality content and internal engagement rather than purely on external metrics like views and retweets. Ayo confirmed that ongoing discussions would be documented to address objections, and Mikasa offered to represent the guild in Governance call. Here is the link to the summary of objections https://docs.google.com/document/d/17zH0s6dl0_tDTgjuCtLCmczHbYIYpHCqz_6zY7OD0n0/edit?usp=sharing",
          "Discussion on Podcast: Photogee expressed concern over the decision to pause the podcast, criticizing it as a unilateral move made without guild consultation. He emphasized the importance of transparency and communication, especially since no explanation had been given by LordKizzy. Photogee warned that such decisions could damage the guild's reputation and stakeholder trust. In response, LordKizzy explained that podcast funding had been discussed in Q3 but was excluded from the Q4 budget due to financial constraints. He noted the podcast's high cost and stressed the need to prioritize lower-cost initiatives to preserve limited reserves, despite recent improvements in token prices. Photogee defended the podcast as a long-term effort that had received positive external feedback. However, LordKizzy reiterated that with shrinking budgets, it's crucial to assess the podcast's impact relative to other initiatives."

          "Task Updates and Project Discussions It was noted in the meeting that some tasks has been completed and some are yet to be completed.  CJfrankie outlined the key obstacles he faced, such as the drop in token price and the difficulty of finding relevant speaking opportunities at events. He highlighted that many events are focused on specific ecosystems, limiting his ability to promote SingularityNet. Ese proposed strategies like exploring collaborations outside the crypto space and organizing community events to enhance outreach. CJfrankie responded positively to the idea shared by Ese, expressed intent to develop a related initiative, and planned to share it in the marketing channel.  The need for proper documentation of the podcast episodes, including metrics and audience engagement, was highlighted to validate the initiative's success. It was also mentioned that the second episode of the podcast has been uploaded to social media, with guest outreach in progress.  Weekly updates on social media reports were proposed to enhance performance tracking. Ese suggested having weekly updates on social media reports could help us track our growth and performance in social media management. While Gorga suggested we should have a document to track development of views just like video Workgroup document.",
          "Afro Multilingual Literacy Drive Discussion Advanceameyaw highlighted the Afro multilingual literacy drive as a key project of the African Guild, focusing on its educational marketing aspects. He sought input on how the Ambassador Group could contribute to the initiative, particularly in terms of publicity. Lordkizzy suggested sharing the created content on our social media and inquired about potential collaborations beyond publicity.",

          "Discussions on Distribution sheet LordKizzy provided context on the distribution sheet, highlighting the need to decide whether to implement biweekly meetings and explore ways to reduce responsibilities across all roles, with an emphasis on scaling back tasks such as facilitation and documentation. LordKizzy introduced two proposed distribution models for the Marketing Guild, based on a total quarterly budget of 7,171 AGIX. Structure 1 retains the current payment system, where Core members receive 150 AGIX per month, and Taskforce members receive 100 AGIX per month. leaving 1,921 AGIX left to spend on simple, low-budget initiatives with clear deliverables. Structure 2 restructures the budget by dividing responsibilities between operations (30%) and initiatives (70%). The operations team is allocated 2,160 AGIX for the quarter. The remaining funds support two initiative groups of four members each, with each group receiving 2,505 AGIX per quarter. This structure enables more strategic funding distribution and clearer task accountability. LordKizzy emphasized the need to clearly define responsibilities and finalize the distribution structure within the first week of the month to avoid planning and payment delays, especially given the reduced funding available.",
          "Discussion on Zealy and Podcast Initiatives: Kenichi raised concerns about the guild's effectiveness, noting that many current activities do not align with marketing objectives, with the podcast being a notable exception. He advocated for each member to propose roles that directly support measurable goals for Q3, suggesting that the podcast should be the flagship initiative. Ese Williams agreed with Kenichi on the importance of establishing a clear direction for the marketing guild's initiatives. She expressed concerns about the podcast's current execution, suggesting that the team should start small and scale gradually. Ese also pointed out the lack of measurable impact from the Zealy initiative on their Twitter metrics, indicating a need for better operational and campaign structures. LordKizzy reiterated the importance of focusing on outcomes rather than outputs, stressing that without proper execution, the guild's efforts would not yield the desired results. Ayo emphasized the need for quick decisions on marketing initiatives, especially the podcast. Ese expressed concerns about the podcast's challenges and suggested launching multiple initiatives to show progress. Kenichi supported the podcast but highlighted the importance of engaging the community through various platforms. LordKizzy recommended running the podcast alongside another initiative to boost social media activity.",
          "Update on GitHub Board: Ese indicated that the July board is prepared but requires restructuring, and she noted that June's social media metrics are still under review due to late submissions. She suggested creating a tabular format for Q3 to better track growth or decline."

          "LordKizzy opened the Marketing Guild call and led a discussion on how to better structure member contributions toward deliverables. Kenichi highlighted the importance of aligning deliverables with broader initiatives rather than assigning tasks to individuals, encouraging members to contribute based on their skills and initiative needs. In contrast, LordKizzy raised concerns about the lack of structure, noting that it could lead to member inactivity or overlapping responsibilities. To address this, he proposed splitting the guild into two groups of four, with each group taking ownership of one initiative and internally assigning roles as needed.  Three possible initiatives were proposed for the quarter: the Podcast, the Scavenger Hunt, and Events. The Podcast initiative was already agreed upon, while the Scavenger Hunt, introduced by Eric Davies, involves a Discord-based game that drives engagement through quizzes tied to videos and articles. The Events initiative was considered less practical due to budget constraints. Kenichi argued it should remain an open contribution activity rather than a dedicated team initiative, with members rewarded individually based on actual contributions.  Ultimately, it was agreed that the guild would focus on just two initiatives this quarter: the Podcast and the Scavenger Hunt. Each group will receive 35% of the total budget, with the remaining budget distributed separately. Members within each group will decide how to split their allocation and assign tasks. Past contributions, like Gorga's graphics, will be treated as extra activities and considered for compensation separately.  The team discussed using a shared spreadsheet to track upcoming events and related contributions. There was also a suggestion to move future meetings to a bi-weekly schedule, though this would only happen after the new structure is finalized. The team will reconvene next week to finalize groups and begin execution."

Lordkizzy clarified that the operations team could assist and shared the budget-2,505 AGIX (~$750) per team per quarter. Photogee raised concerns about balanced discussion dynamics, suggesting all members should voice their perspectives before decision-making. Lordkizzy reinforced the non-hierarchical nature of the team, clarifying there were no designated leads and emphasizing self-organized collaboration as the expected working model. The team adopted a self-selection approach for group formation, Podcast team are: Ayo,Photogee,Kareem,Mikasa and Kenichi. while Scavenger hunt team are: Gorga,Kateri,CJ Frankie,Eric Davies. The team was advised to form subgroups and start discussions to prepare documentation ahead of the next meeting."

While he doesn't want to make any final decisions yet, he emphasized the need to monitor the situation. Since everyone is aware of the issue now, any future actions should not be seen as targeting anyone.",
          "Lord Kizzy presented two reward systems for extra activities, responding to concerns about unpaid rewards last month. He stressed the need to choose a system to ensure timely payments and suggested testing both options. The team also discussed a 20% cut to the Q4 marketing budget, emphasizing the need for strategic adjustments. The meeting ended with agreement on categorizing extra activities under tier one and discussed the token values, leading to a consensus on the distribution plan."

Engagement Updates: Uri (MindPlex CEO) is unavailable (surgery), Cabrillo (Nunez CEO) faced network issues, Jasmine is unwell, and Aidy hasn't been reached yet.  Next Steps: Team agreed to produce at least one episode this quarter-possibly leveraging ambassadors or internal team members to ensure timely delivery.",
          "Scavenger Hunt Update & Outcomes: Eric Davies stated that Only 11 participants joined due to low awareness and delayed launch. QuizBot limited the experience, though participants still found it fun. Feedback suggested improving question quality and point distribution.  Lordkizzy stressed that reports should reflect real outcomes, not just activities, and requested commentable reports for collaboration. He noted goal misalignment and execution challenges.  Eric Davies highlighted the aim of driving engagement and education about SingularityNET despite outreach issues. Advanceameyaw added that consistent participation, though small, still showed positive impact.  Chatbot & Alternatives Discussion: Custom Discord chatbots estimated at $500-$2,000. Alternatives such as QuizBot and ZilliBot via Zapier were suggested to cut costs.  Community Engagement & Future Planning: Lordkizzy emphasized stronger community engagement and social media amplification, aiming to address criticisms of inorganic participation. September was proposed for the next scavenger hunt, with improved promotion. Ese Williams suggested rebranding the scavenger hunt to highlight education and meaningful onboarding for better perception and impact.",

Lordkizzy added that the main issue was the lack of posting and announcements for the scavenger hunt on X, due to problems with the social media accounts manager. He mentioned that he can retrieve the YouTube analytics and send them to Advance, and also confirmed that he has access to the Medium account. Advance asked about the winner announcement template and noted that the hunt ends today. Lordkizzy inquired about accessing the leaderboard without paying for the bot and whether to continue the scavenger hunt or try a new initiative. Advance suggested redefining the scavenger hunt, while Lordkizzy mentioned other challenges like token price. Gorga proposed replacing the social media manager with Kateri, but Lordkizzy said login access is the main problem. Lordkizzy requested that the scavenger hunt team send the budget breakdown, along with the distribution sheet and the rewards structure for both the participants and the team members so that he can process their payment next week.",

Obviously this was not the budget we submitted for Q2, but we agreed that the redyuctions are necessary - so unless token price rises again, changes will take effect as of April.",

Many new people go first to Governance WG. - Love: Some people have expressed interest in partnerships with sNET, but didn't seem committed. Peter agreed that most inquiries about partnerships via social media are not genuine; legitimate proposals typically arise from real-life interactions.   Sucre emphasized broadening onboarding strategies to include ecosystem spin-offs. Peter supported the idea, noting that full onboarding into spin-offs might not be feasible but that inviting them to town halls could be valuable.",
          "Onboarding experiences and engagement:   Alfred noted in the chat that when he first joined he was only told to join meetings and when he joined he was still confused. He felt that the onboarders should give more context when onboarding.   Love responded that she gives out meeting summaries, budget sheets, quarterly reports, etc in cases like this.  Lord Kizzy noted that we cannot possibly create onboarding materials that will answer every question and give all possible context = rather, we need to create an environment that enables a new person tpo ask questions that focus on what they personally want to know.  Alfred went on to highlight his initial confusion about the program but noted that attending meetings, particularly with African Guild and Governance WG, helped him engage more deeply and understand the context of the conversations. He highlighted the confusion new members face when joining Discord, suggesting that live onboarding sessions - either in groups or one-to-one - could enhance their understanding of the ambassador program.   Vani reminded the group that previously onboarding sessions had low turnout, which led to discontinuing them. We could consider trying them again at some point, but for now, one-to-one engagement async is our approach.",
          "AI Agents for Onboarding:   AI Sandbox/Think Tank has been discussing the idea of AI agents for onboarding. Vasu presented insights from the discussions, aimed at addressing FAQs and being available 24/7. He proposed integration with Discord, Notion, and GitHub to create personalized member journeys based on individual skills and interests. He proposed a four-phase implementation plan which includes setup, integration, testing with 10-20 users, and a full launch aiming to address 100s of queries per month   He did npt finish the presentation due to time constraints, but the group agreed to support the idea and help devise context for the agent. However, we noted that with the lower numbers coming into the Program at the moment (largely a result of low token price and low availability of paid tasks), we wou;ld be unlikely to be able to test it at scale."

Chsanges to reporting requirements for this Quarter: the report now needs to include  - a clear statement of WG purpose (we already have this in previous reports) - a section on outcomes/impact (we will add info on collaboration with Education guild on the AMA session with Rejuve means more people understand SingularityNet as a whole; mentoring new people more extensively; and and encouraging new people to feel confident to ask questions to support their onboarding. - a reflection section on what could have gone better.  We have retained our usual section for WG members to give their own reflections on how they felt about this quarter - members were reminded to add anything they would like to say.  Deadline: 15th Sept.",
          "Onboarders update:   The team, consisting of five onboarders plus Sucre, continue to welcome newcomers, answer questions, help direct people to suitable workgroups. They reviewed their tracker to check on progress: some participants were fully onboarded and active, others less so, and some have dropped off. The team plans to follow up with those who never fully onboarded but are still around, but hey noted that it is difficult to get 'exit interview' information from those who have left completely, so we don't usually find out why they go.",
          "New member Ayomi suggested introducing a feedback form at the end of each Onboarding WG meeting to gather input from participants and improve future sessions. The team agreed it was a great idea, so Ayomiu will draft a form and share it async."

The Idea is to invite representatives from ecosystem spinoffs (e.g. Deep Funding, SophiaVerse, Rejuve, Mind Children, Incantio, and Deep Noise) to engage with the Ambassador Program. The aim is to enable contributors to learn how to participate, contribute, and potentially earn within spinoffs, reinforcing the Ambassador Program's role across the ecosystem. This quarter's scope is limited to 3 spinoffs for focused outreach (Mind children, Incantio and Deep noise). It was decided that this engagement will take the form of an AMA session. Members agreed to prepare general questions aligned with the scope of invitation, while participants will have the opportunity to ask random questions towards the end of the session.",

The Education Guild agreed to contribute $50 toward the cost but the overall cost went slightly above the initial budget and so we agreed to find a way and cover it."

Advance shared his concerns about project sustainability and the Guild's decision-making process. He felt that decisions were often centralized and made without the awareness or approval of guild members. He also pointed out that no funding was allocated to sustain the SBD project, which he found unfair compared to the support other projects received. Additionally, he mentioned working for several months without any form of compensation. Kenichi outlined the goals of the revamped Research and Development Guild, focusing on the skills database and the Legacy project as tools for community engagement and governance. He expressed frustration over the lack of support for the ambassador program website and the challenges faced in integrating various projects, particularly due to technical issues with Cardano.

Kenichi highlighted issues regarding project management in R&D, specifically the policy that prohibits one contributor from managing multiple projects and the necessity of having at least two team members per project. Guillermo addressed the issue of the policy, on the necessity of having at least two team members per project. He noted that he has a team member is working with him on the project.    No conclusions were reached during the call, and it was agreed that a follow-up meeting would be held next Wednesday to finalize decisions."

          "AI Tool Development and Collaboration Strategies Guillermo discussed the roadmap for developing AI tools using the ASI stack, emphasizing the need for collaboration and resource sharing within the ecosystem. They highlighted the importance of cognitive capacities and ethical considerations in defining the AI's personality. The conversation also touched on the necessity of organizing ideas and prioritizing tasks to build a comprehensive framework for AI assistance.",
          "Data Integration and AI Assistant Development Tevo Kask and Guillermo focused on the integration of data sources into a machine-readable format for the AI assistant. They highlighted the need for contextual training to ensure the AI can effectively assist with governance decisions within the Ambassador Program. Esther Galfalvi raised questions about the expected interactions with the AI assistant, while Vani pointed out the necessity of including relevant historical context to improve decision-making. Guillermo highlighted their significant usage of the AI assistant, with nearly a thousand interactions recorded since its launch. Vani questioned the method of counting these interactions, seeking clarity on whether they referred to individual chats or posts. The discussion also touched on the importance of having a disclaimer for deeper analysis of the AI assistant's conversations.",
          "Data Privacy and Ethics Discussion Esther and Vani engaged in a discussion about the implications of data privacy and consent in their community. Vani argued that the focus should be on data privacy rather than AI ethics, expressing concerns about the potential for misuse of data. Guillermo recognized the importance of establishing a clear consent process and the need for transparency regarding data usage, while also noting the difficulties in managing individual consent in a small community. Guillermo highlighted the benefits of increased transparency in their reporting processes, noting that visibility encourages better attention to detail and accountability. Vani questioned the distinction between past and current reporting practices, suggesting that visibility has always existed. Esther proposed that the formalization of reports might enhance their perceived immutability."

Q4 workshop: Clement noted that last quarter we talked about cross collaboration, new approaches other guilds could adopt to hence the cross collaboration and he is looking forward to this being implemented.  Q1 budget in perspective research, workshop, collaboration and other initiative: Effiom noted that for the Q1 budget approval we were allocated 4,000 AGIX which is 2200 USD. He also noted that the guild will continue in our biweekly meetings which is a total of 7 meetings this quarter. He said the roaster for the quarter will be shared in the next meetings, he noted that due to the fact that treasury operator call is biweekly it means that task management will also be biweekly. For the initiatives and ideas, he noted that we are only going to have one research and one workshop this quarter though there are already some ideas from last quarter but new ideas can still come in and after we would decide as a guild and choose one.  Async follow up initiative: Effiom noted that we adopted this in Q4 because our first workshop was in Q3. The async follow up team in Q4 were to follow up on the initiative and ideas presented in the Q3 workshop and that of the async follow up team in Q1 are to focus and follow up on the initiative and ideas presented in Q4 workshop.  Q1 prospective: Ayo noted for Q1 workshop we can engage Gamers guild, AI Sandbox/Think tank, Archive workgroup and AI ethics workgroup. Gorga expressed interest to represent Gamers workgroup.  Ayo ask members for their ideas for Q1 workshop and research  Gorga  Kizzy mentioned that for the Q1 workshop he sees a synergy between Onboarding, AI Sandbox/Think tank and Gamers guild in terms of community engagement. Clement mentioned that we could do a research to establish synergy between the regional expansion initiatives that we currently in the ambassador program  Mikasa said we engaged on only three workgroup for the last quarter and so we should continue on that  Peter said the workgroups to focus on for the workshop should be demand driven. We should cater for Workgroups that have certain demands.",

        "narrative": "Kick-off: The monthly meeting of the strategy guild started strong with Clement as he welcomed everyone to the first official meeting in March. Then we skimmed through the action items and agreed with the minutes of the last meeting-held on January 27th.   Updates on Q1 Workshop  by Ese: Ese shared an update on the Q1Workshop, which is currently in progress! She stated that a few people have filled out the form, which is expected to close in the coming weeks-the date wasn't specified! Ayo applauded her and said that the process could be a bit faster so that she could present the research work in the last town hall session.   SingularityNET AI Marketplace by Clement: The meeting featured Clement Umoh, who showcased the progress with the Guild's current research work on the 'SingularityNET AI Marketplace.' He emphasized the need for ambassadors to understand how the marketplace works. He also added that the purpose of the research work is to understand the potential gaps and ensure that the sNET Ambassadors use the AI marketplace. According to Clement, the research is in the data-collection phase-so he encourages everyone on the call to contribute to the research. After his presentation, MaxMiles commented on his efforts and progress so far.   Q2 in Perspective by AYO: As Q1 draws to a close, the Strategy Guild reflects on its achievements and looks forward to a promising Q2. Ayo stated that the guild will continue to deliver workshop sessions and conduct research, though there will be only three calls in Q2. This conversation led to a decision-making process. We deliberated on whether to host the calls on the first or last Monday of each month. Clement shared his opinion, but Effiom's suggestion was adopted. He proposed that the guild hold its monthly meetings on the first Monday of each month, while the remaining weeks are used to track task progress asynchronously. Async Unit by Effiom: Speaking of keeping abreast with the latest updates in the guild, the Async unit will begin to function again. These Async guys are people who will follow up with members and workgroups to keep track of their progress.   New Members Discussion: Speaking of new members, MaxMiles asked how onboarding works in the guild. Ayo explained that the Strategy Guild operates differently from other workgroups. To be considered a member, one must be active in at least five workgroups. In response, MaxMiles mentioned that he has been active in several workgroups, including Strategy.   Budget: In this meeting, we reviewed our Q2 budget. With 4,000 AGIX allocated, we agreed to reduce meeting time and focus on high-priority tasks such as research and workshops. Ayo also encouraged everyone to participate in the consent rounds   AOB: 'Effiom raised a concern: 'Since we're reverting to monthly meetings, how do we track our progress? How do we know what people are doing?' He suggested using GitHub to monitor task progress, but Effiom pointed out that optimizing GitHub would be challenging and that there wasn't any budget allocated for it. After that, Jeffrey introduced himself, and the meeting came to a close.'",

        "narrative": "Intro: The call opened with Ayo asking UknowZork how she's been coping, especially since many of the guild meetings have now shifted to a bi-weekly schedule. He also asked if she's been getting or taking up tasks. UknowZork shared that she's been able to pick up small documentation tasks and is hopeful for more opportunities. Ayo encouraged her, noting that consistent participation and attending calls is the best approach. He asked if UknowZork attends AI Sandbox calls, as they're a great space for learning and growth. Ayo mentioned that the meeting would proceed as planned, though it might be shorter due to fewer attendees. He asked everyone to wait a couple of minutes while he prepared the updates. There was a light moment when Ayo joked about mixing up who's based where, sharing how he recently visited Uyo and Calabar but wasn't sure who from the team lived there. Finally, Ayo said he would share the agenda on screen and suggested using the last meeting's agenda summary as a base since no new notes had been posted yet.     Q2 Updates / Workshop / approach / Research & May TownHall Presentation  Ayo shared details about the survey form and shared that since they hadn't been getting much feedback before, the team had decided to change their strategy. Instead of trying to get input during the guild meetings or workshops, like they had originally planned, they're now shifting to a more direct approach. The plan is to reach out to people individually with specific questions, gather their responses, analyze the data, and then send back the results. He explained that the challenge right now is figuring out exactly who to contact in each guild. For example, in the African Guild, they need to identify three reliable members-people who still show up consistently for calls, even with the token price drop. This way, they can be sure they'll get the responses they need.  Ayo also gave an update on the Q2 research, noting that it's a continuation of the Q1 work. They're partnering with Deep Funding and have already compiled a list of documents that he had previously shared with Deep Funding. The main challenge has been figuring out which guild circles to focus on. At first, it seemed like the research was for the IT circle, then it looked like the Review circle, then Data Analytics, and finally Operations. Since Ayo wasn't able to attend the April meeting, he mentioned it might be a good idea to attend the May one for more clarity. He also pointed out that for the Q3 budget, it's already known that the token price has dropped, and there will be cuts to the budget for each workgroup or guild. For instance, Strata Guild is now set to receive $861, which is adjusted to 2,868 AGX tokens at the current rate of $0.3 per AGX. So, the budgets are definitely tighter. He expressed some uncertainty about the research project-whether it's happening at all. With the end of May approaching and only a few weeks left in the quarter, time is running out. Clement added his thoughts, saying that this was the original vision-getting people who are active in the whole AI market space so they could collect more expansive data for fresh perspectives on the analysis. He also took a moment to appreciate the effort of the research team.     AOB: Ayo expressed some uncertainty about the research project-whether it's happening at all. With the end of May approaching and only a few weeks left in the quarter, time is running out.  Jeffery brought up the next steps for the research, reminding Ayo that he had mentioned including him as part of the research team, but he hadn't heard anything since. Ayo apologized for the communication gap, admitting he hadn't been very active on Discord lately and hadn't seen any clear details about including him as part of the research team. After reviewing past conversations, he didn't find much concrete information and suggested there might have been a misunderstanding or missing context. In a lighthearted moment, Ayo even joked that if he had said Jeffery was on the research team, he must have been 'really drunk,' as Jeffery isn't a core member of the Guild.  To smooth things over, Ayo reassured him that he would double-check the meeting details and do a follow up with him. Kateri also mentioned she had some pending messages that hadn't been addressed yet. Ayo apologized again and promised to get back to her after the call.  The meeting wrapped up with Ayo encouraging both Kateri and Jeffery to reach out so they could clarify things and move forward together.",

Daniel contributed to the discussion by confirming the dates and emphasizing the importance of workshops in between meetings. Action items were assigned to ensure that the schedule is communicated effectively.  Research Focus on AI Marketplace Awareness  Ayo emphasized the need for ambassadors of SNET to be aware of the AI solutions available in the marketplace, as part of a research initiative to assess their knowledge. Clement's engaging presentation on this subject led to plans for him to present again at the deep funding town hall. Ayo also encouraged members to consider potential research topics for Q2.  Decision Reminders and Asynchronous Unit Members  Ese Williams led a discussion on decision reminders for Q2, confirming the monthly meeting and the need for new asynchronous unit members. Ayo emphasized the importance of selecting the right candidates for these roles, expressing concerns about the challenges of asynchronous communication. Daniel Effiom noted that while three members are usually selected, only two would be needed for project six, and he encouraged nominations from the group.  Core Membership Discussion and Q1 Wrap-Up  Ayo outlined the steps for announcing core membership opportunities and conducting a poll to gauge interest. He encouraged newcomers, including Jeffrey, to engage in the Strategy Guild's channel on Discord for better communication. Ayo also highlighted that active involvement in other work groups is necessary for those seeking core membership.  Clarification of the process for becoming a core member within the guild.  Workshop Planning and Feedback  Ayo suggested organizing a workshop for the next quarter that would incorporate insights from the African and Latham Guilds while considering collaboration with the European Guild. Daniel pointed out difficulties in attendance for the current workshop and proposed a new strategy that involves visiting guild members in their own environments.

        "narrative": "The meeting began with Ayo welcoming everyone to the call.  Q2 Retrospect: Ayo discussed the challenges faced in Q2, particularly the effects of token depreciation on community engagement and the necessity for motivated members in the Strategy Guild. He noted that the devaluation of the token has demotivated contributors who seriously want to be active in strategy. Daniel Effiom contributed by noting that the planned workshops had to adapt due to changes in workgroup schedules and a general decline in activity. He emphasized the importance of timely communication and updates within the ecosystem and encouraged that we should update the community on what we are doing via town hall meetings.  Q3 Budget Update: Daniel Effiom outlined the strategy Guild's budget, emphasizing that the core budget lines have not changed. He reported a decrease in available funds from $1,200 to $862 and mentioned the possibility of using reserves to cover any additional costs that may arise during the quarter. Effiom assured that all budget lines were accounted for and that any adjustments would be documented for transparency.  Workshop Update: Ayo discussed the difficulties faced during recent workshops due to a decline in contributor activeness. Kateri led the update and proposed two potential directions for upcoming workshops:  > Focusing on foundational workgroups, including Governance, AI Ethics, and Strategy.  > Focusing on support workgroups that give support to community such as Onboarding, Gamers, and Translation  After some discussion, the group leaned towards prioritizing the Support workgroups.  Research Update on SingularityNet AI Marketplace: Clement shared insights on research into the SingularityNET AI Marketplace. He explained that the research aims to identify knowledge gaps and improve engagement by including feedback from the Deep Funding community, which is crucial for understanding the marketplace's usability. He highlighted the importance of knowledge transfer and communication in fostering greater involvement. He stated the research framework objectives are Identify knowledge gaps, enhance community engagement, and assess understanding and awareness levels. The key research areas are; Understanding/awareness, engagement/utilization, communication/knowledge transfer, and strategic growth improvement. and that the methodology approach would be through Surveys, interviews, hands-on testing, polls, and comparative analysis of similar programs.  The meeting ended with Ayo noting that the tasks assigned should be concluded before the next monthly meeting to ensure the success of the guild.",

Omolola shared a brief introduction and expressing enthusiasm about joining the community.  Updates on Workshop and Action Items: Kateri reported on the workshop, stating she sent a summary to guilds and workgroups but received minimal feedback. Ayo acknowledged the challenges of decentralized communication and encouraged members to compile their reports for submission.  Research Collaboration Update: Clement reported on the ongoing research collaboration with the Deep Funding Circle. He noted that the development of over 40 research questions that have been condensed to encourage survey participation They are now exploring the most suitable frequency for conducting the research quarterly, monthly, or annually and are awaiting feedback on the revised set of questions before moving forward with distribution. Ayo highlighted the successful collaboration with different circles during recent meetings and expressed gratitude to Clement and Oscar for their support.  He announced the town hall meeting scheduled for tomorrow and encouraged volunteers to present updates for the Strategy Guild.  Discussion on Strategy Guild Sentiment and Engagement: Ayo initiated a discussion on the Strategy Guild's perceived value, expressing concern that many community members do not fully understand its role, which could threaten its long-term sustainability. He shared his personal experiences, noting that participation in the guild feels less rewarding compared to other commitments. Ayo also highlighted broader community challenges and stressed the importance of ensuring an equitable distribution of control and resources across the ecosystem to strengthen decentralized structures and improve overall effectiveness.  He emphasized that the Strategy Guild remains underfunded, which contributes to low attendance and engagement.  On workgroup dynamics, Ayo questioned the autonomy of workgroups and the logic behind budget allocations, particularly for the Ambassadors Program. Tevo responded by stressing the importance of cohesion over strict alignment and highlighted open communication as key. Both agreed on the challenges of maintaining engagement and recognition across workgroups.  On budget matters, Ayo called for stronger delivery from the Strategy Guild, while Clement pointed out its limited budget of $864 per quarter. Clement criticized over-reliance on sentiment analysis in evaluating workgroups, suggesting that more rational and measurable methods should be used.  Finally, the group discussed recognition and communication. Participants noted that the Strategy Guild's contributions often go unnoticed, calling for more proactive communication to increase visibility. Ayo argued that the guild's research is meaningful and should not be undermined by budget limitations. It was also observed that negative perceptions are often influenced by past grievances rather than current performance.",

Budget Update and Strategic Planning: Effiom reported that the Strategy Guild's budget has been cut by 50%, leaving them with $400 for the upcoming quarter. The budget will primarily cover administrative expenses, and the guild plans to continue holding meetings while shifting to asynchronous follow-ups for research initiatives. Effiom expressed concern over objections to the budget proposal despite the reduced amount.  Workshop Update and Feedback: Kateri shared insights from the workshop, highlighting that ten participants contributed to discussions about challenges faced by their work groups. Key issues included insufficient budgets and the irregular scheduling of meetings, which made it difficult for members to stay engaged. Suggestions for improvement focused on increasing collaboration among work groups, although many suggestions were beyond their control (insufficient decision).  Research: Ayo gave update on behave of Clement, he noted that the research is progressing and currently we are in the stage where the research survey is being distributed to specific teams. The collaboration involves several circles, including data analytics, operation, dev outreach, review and IT, which enhances the research's scope. Deep funding wants to make sure that this research remains an ongoing research and Ayo ensure the workgroup that before mid-October it should have been conducted.  Budget and Performance Review: Effiom discussed the quarterly reports, noting eight thumbs up and one downward vote regarding the guild's performance. We went through the Guild proposal, budget and the comment on the governance dashboard.  A.O.B: Ayo announce that anyone with an idea that would love to be funded should communicate on our channel, so it could be included in the funding proposal",

Once all attendees were present, the meeting began with the review of agenda items. The discussion then moved to Q4 budget proposal updates. Since most members had already attended the previous governance call, the group agreed to proceed directly with the budget outlook.  Q4 Outlook: Ayo spoke about Q4 tasks and encouraged everyone to begin their work without delay. Effiom reported that the workshop materials and setup from the previous quarter were successful and well-prepared. The focus for this quarter will be to gather feedback from workgroups on how they have applied the workshop's solutions and outcomes.  Token Price & Budget: Ayo emphasized that the Q4 budget allocation is significantly smaller, compounded by a drastic drop in token prices. This shortfall has made it impossible to cover task obligations, raising concerns about how to proceed. Alfred stressed that payments should not be withheld despite market volatility. He gave the example of AI Ethics, where withholding payments during a downturn led to even worse outcomes as the token value continued to fall. He cautioned that it is often better to disburse funds when conditions are relatively better. Alfred also proposed that payments be made in AGIX (the local token) rather than USD.  This was noted as a good suggestion, with agreement that members should reflect on it and revisit the decision at the next meeting.  TownHall Presentation: Effiom to present the guild update in the townhall meeting.  A.O.B: Ayo shared that the research has officially begun and has already been shared. We are now in the stage of awaiting responses from participants. Further updates will follow as responses come in.",

          "Alfred inquired about the distinction between the Treasury Guild (TG) and the Treasury Automation Workgroup (TAWG). Tevo clarified that TG focuses on service operations like validating contributions and making on-chain transactions, while TAWG is the community-facing group that steers the development of the treasury tools themselves. Tevo presented development updates from August,including the integration of an AI co-pilot into the Treasury Manager for more effective feature development and debugging. Find the recorded session here[Treasury Automation WG - 02.09.25 Development Updates ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U8WALcJp6Y&t=4s)  A new, more modular codebase is being used, which will allow for easier distribution of treasury tools and features across different projects and networks. Regression testing has been completed on the new version of the Treasury Manager to ensure stability before its upcoming deployment. Updates to the Zoom integration were discussed, noting that some manual verification is still required due to API limitations, but the time cost is minimal. Tevo shared the video recording of the [End-to-End Treasury Operation Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1kspl_6bKc) for members interested in the full operational process.

One of the deliverables would be to create weekly Ambassadors TownHall recaps and a weekly digest that covers key highlights from workgroups and guilds, such as reminders or callouts!   Web3 publishing platforms: As a follow-up from Q4 2024, we have decided to explore and tap into the endless possibilities of Web3 platforms. Kenichi hinted that Scribblers could be assigned to some platforms to coordinate the articles. The cornerstone benefit of leveraging these platforms is the fact that we get to monetize them, and secondly, there are a lot of Web3 enthusiasts who use this platform, so it's a great way to connect with them. In addition to this, scribblers are urged to research various platforms that might interest them to manage.   Twitter giveaway contest: Kenichi added that there is an X giveaway in the pipeline. This giveaway will be a marketing strategy for the WWG and will run for 2 weeks. Although we're still incubating this idea, more updates will be shared in future meetings. Plus, there would be a pool of $100, and we could set up a bot that randomly selects winners.   Trivia: The Friday trivia game will still maintain the biweekly schedule.  Role document: Lastly, Kenichi added that it's time to revisit the role document. This document helps the WG review thresholds for scribblers and scribes. These thresholds are like KPIs for each member of the workgroup. It helps assign new roles, such as scribes, to members who merit them and also relinquish some roles for underperforming members.",

Kenechi went on to share with us how the AI Cryptography draft was giving a boost to our other Articles on the community page and he Suggested it would be the right time to bring in a new article.  We also discussed how to draw traffic to the community page when Kenechi mentioned our stats proved our performance to be poor. Kenechi urged us to take our community growth seriously and to look out for more platforms that will enable us achieve a wider reach. In the light of this, he brought up a recently launched community page in Mirror, asking for ideas on how we could make it active and also get new subscribers.   We decided on rewarding people who mint our articles and offer more engagements on our page. This reward could be given at the end of a quarter or based off engagement overtime as loyalty rewards for checking our content. Kenechi encouraged members of the Workgroup to subscribe to the community page on mirror and connect their metamask wallet.  Kenichi reminded us that the 'Role Document' https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Snol58978ZkEtWpIBv0VNEwqsdM8ZHz9jsvOyr4qmA4/edit?usp=sharing  was scheduled to be live and actively in use from February. Stating the effect of this would be that Scribes must attend at least three meetings a month whole scribblers must be present in at least two meetings in each month to maintain their roles. He added that the analysis will come at the end of six months to give everyone enough time to make an impression but, he would start a poll in the Writers' WG Channel to be sure of a good number, if not everyone would welcome this.",

        "narrative": "Kick-off: The writers' workgroup weekly meeting kicked off at 3:10 p.m. Kenichi skimmed through the action items from the last meeting.   Twitter Premium+: We started by discussing how three workgroups (writers, video, and marketing) can collaborate to subscribe to a Twitter premium plan. Kenichi added that it would be a great idea for us to pay for a yearly subscription.   Community page on X: One of the WWG's missions for 2025 is to see our platforms grow while reaching a wider audience, such as crypto and web3 enthusiasts. In our last meeting, we decided to start pushing out Town Hall recaps: a weekly report that covers highlights from the ambassadors program. More so, the monthly workgroup updates are no different! We also seek to share these insights with the community using the community page on X. Kenichi also spoke about the need for having moderators on the community page to oversee the process and also reply to questions from anyone. Additionally, he urged Scribblers to join the page and also introduce themselves.  Momentarily, Mikasa added that some of the engagement on X is from people outside the ambassador program; she suggested integrating a bot that would create an announcement on the discord server for people to see when new announcements are made. This led to a discussion about whether to have a separate channel for these announcements. Kenichi embraced the idea and said he'd reach out to Peter to discuss things further.  Web3 publishing platforms: This conversation started in Q4 2024. In this meeting, CjFrankie showcased Mirror.XYZ. A Web3 publishing platform that allows publishers to turn their fans or readers into collectors, it also allows publishers to mint all their content, and it allows for collaboration through co-authorship and multi-sigs. In the same light, Gorga introduced Cardano Spot, he added that the WWG can take advantage of it since we're building on a Cardano platform, he said that the platform enables users to create a community and also publish their work. Kenichi embraced the idea and he asked Gorga to make a presentation for the next meeting, on Friday. Additionally, Kenichi proposed that CjFrankie and Gorga should write an introductory draft for Mirror and Cardano Spot respectively. The draft should introduce the SNET ambassador program, reference the latest updates like the ecosystem digest, and the first introductory draft of the ambassador program published on Medium.   Zealy collaboration: The meeting featured the likes of LordKizzy, who seeks collaboration between WWG, video WG, and the marketing guild. According to Kenichi, the next Zealy sprint would kick off by February, and as a result, the three workgroups would need to discuss what the reward structure would be like, how quests would be reviewed, and whatnot.   Role document: The WWG role document describes the roles of scribblers and scribes in the workgroup; Kenichi hinted that the role document would become active from the next meeting. Come next week, we shall review the document to see the KPIs attached to the roles we hold.",

Everything looks good, and it favors old and new members, unlike previous sprints, where some participants had an edge over others.   In the meeting, we reviewed task progress on the Dework board. Kenichi also asked the Scribblers for article suggestions, which he added to the board right away. He mentioned that he has some drafts to upload, while CjFrankie suggested that Scribes should also be able to create tasks on Dework.  Speaking of engagement, Kenichi mentioned that it would be a good idea to create threads, retweet, and quote articles posted on the SNET X page. This discussion led to questions about when the WWG would get a premium plan. Kenichi suggested that the marketing guild and the WWG could join forces to acquire the premium plan. We also agreed to table the discussion for the next marketing guild call to better understand where each workgroup stands.  Kenichi suggested that there should be a weekly article recap that highlights all the articles published within a week; he also suggested that the weekly Substack digest should also cover these highlights. Following that, CjFrankie expressed his concern about low engagements and interactions with the Substack newsletter. From the backend side of things, we used Substack analytics to analyze our visitors and readers over time. The record shows that the newsletter piques the interest of people across four USA states and in 15 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, and Argentina. Just to mention a few! Having studied this data, Kenichi mentioned that we may start publishing content at specific time zones to help us get the most out of our readers.   Mirror: Our goal and mission for Mirror. XYZ is to continue spreading content to people from all walks of life. In the long run, we'd reward people for reading our articles using NFTs. Role document: Last but not least, Kenichi announced that the role document is officially live, though it will take effect from Q2 2025. Some adjustments have been made-the pupil role has been removed, leaving only the Scribbler and Scribe roles. Starting in Q2, workgroup members will need to meet their thresholds to retain their roles. Those who fail to meet their thresholds will face questions about their continuity. This approach will also help the workgroup onboard more members.",

The first item on our agenda centered on reopening the onboarding window for new people to join the workgroup; however, it would be possible if the AGIX token pumps.  Twitter Premium+: Following a discussion with the marketing guild meeting at 12 p.m. UTC today, we're pleased to inform everyone that the video WG, marketing guild, and the writer's workgroup have reached a consensus on splitting the payment for Twitter premium. The WWG will send a share of $76 to Peter, while other workgroups follow suit to purchase the $229 yearly plan. Once we have successfully gotten X premium, the general monthly updates shall be the first piece that will be published there! Kenichi also mentioned that the long-awaited Twitter contest will be shared in the next meeting.   DRAFTs: In this meeting, Kenichi brought up the idea of using a spreadsheet for collecting article suggestions from the writers; he added that the sheet will enable us to track the draft's progress. Speaking of graphics, he added that the sheet will help the graphics team in creating graphics even before a particular draft is ready for publication.   Web3 publishing platforms: We welcomed Lady Tempestt, who has been away for a while! Kenichi briefed her about the Web3 publishing platforms that we recently launched (Mirror and CardanoSpot). He urged the workgroup members to also source platforms with the potential for success and showcase them in the meeting. Kenichi hinted that at come next meeting, we'd talk more about Mirror and how the NFT minting process will play out eventually.   Role document: Following a discussion at the previous meeting, Kenichi mentioned that the role document will be accessed this quarter; no penalties whatsoever! It will only help us to track all the writer's progress over time; plus, it'll help the WG to make informed decisions going forward, such as if the workgroup needs to onboard new people or not!",

Furthermore, Kenichi stated that the Web3 publishing platforms required additional attention and, to that end, requested that Cj Frankie and Gorga submit their first drafts.  DRAFTs: As agreed in the previous meeting, article suggestions will now be submitted via spreadsheet. In this meeting, Kenichi demonstrated the new writer's draft submission form, which streamlines the process. Writers can now suggest articles, include submission and preferred publication dates, and provide other relevant information. The form's integration with a Google Sheet simplifies tracking for the workgroup. Ines also recommended considering tools like Trello to further enhance workflow. In response to a question from Lady Tempestt, Kenichi confirmed that both writers and scribes will have access to the submission form. Once a draft is approved, the scribes will submit it to the community page. Kenichi will coordinate with Peter to pin the form link to the writer's channel for easy access.  Role document: Ines inquired about the new role document and its associated thresholds. Kenichi clarified that the document would be accessible this quarter and that there would be no penalties for not meeting any outlined expectations. He explained that the document's purpose is to track Scribblers' progress over time, enabling the workgroup to make informed decisions, such as whether or not to onboard new members.  Ambassador program website: In this meeting, Ines proposed the idea of creating a platform or WordPress for the workgroup, where all information about what we do can be easily accessed!

This site will house comprehensive information about all participating workgroups, each of which will have its dedicated page with updated access.",

We learned in the meeting that we have only 1029 AGIX left (about 279 USD). This led to a discussion on whether the workgroup should have a wallet outside the ambassador program, just like the archives WG. This idea was first proposed in Q4 2024 when the token price depreciated. Kenichi also added that the Marketing Guild has a wallet outside the Treasury, which was used to distribute rewards for the Zealot campaign initiative. Kenichi added that the only solution is to adjust outgoing rewards to match the current price of AGIX or   Additionally, February point system rewards weren't distributed last week due to the token devaluation. In light of this, the workgroup should dip into their Q4 2024 reserve. More so, moving forward, only high-priority tasks will be assigned, and Trivia sessions will pause until further notice. Kenichi also mentioned that if AGIX keeps dipping, all outstanding payments might wait until March 28th.",

This left a total of roughly 4,709 AGIX unallocated. The Governance WG had already proposed using the 1,554 AGIX to compensate for facilitation of governance meetings, which are currently unpaid. Alfred confirmed he was the one who originally made this proposal.  There was debate on how to handle these funds. Normally, unused money returns to reserves. Peter said he supported governance WG work but worried it could be unfair to other groups if the funds were allocated without following a clear process. Alfred suggested reframing it: governance WG would 'collect' the funds before they entered the reserves, rather than pulling them back out afterward.  Vani added context: in the budget caps meeting, the agreement was to return surplus funds to reserves 'for now.' Later, in a governance meeting, it was suggested that governance WG add the 1,500 AGIX to its budget and rely on objections if anyone disagreed. That passed the consent round. She also emphasized that the 3,155 AGIX from the Moderators Workgroup should be treated separately, since no discussion had taken place about reallocating it. By default, it should return to reserves.  Everyone agreed that if a workgroup wants additional funds, there should be a clear process for requesting them from reserves. At the same time, Vani cautioned against making the process too complicated or turning it into a 'begging letter' system. Guillermo suggested moving decisions to the Governance Dashboard, but Vani explained that the Dashboard doesn't yet support the 'does anyone object?' style of decision-making.  In conclusion, we agreed to put two items in the 'Decision to be Made' channel: Ask contributors if they agree to allocate 1,500 AGIX to governance WG. Confirm that the moderators' leftover 3,155 AGIX should go back to reserves.  We also agreed that if anyone objects to the second point, alternative proposals for using that amount could then be discussed.",
