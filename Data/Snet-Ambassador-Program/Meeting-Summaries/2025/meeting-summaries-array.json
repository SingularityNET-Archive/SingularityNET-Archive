We'll give reminders in Town Hall tonight, and on Discord; and hopefully discuss in Governance meeting on Thurs 9th or Thurs 16th when we have more input.  Retrospective on Q1 consent process: - We noted that GovWG meeting on Tues 14th is scheduled to be the retrospective session on the Q1 budget consent process. - Peter has yet to DM Core Contributors who didn't take part in the Q1 budget approval process, to find out why they didn't. He'll do it as soon as poss. - We will also ask Tevo if he has data on how many Core Contributors did take part this time (it's hard to tell from the Googleform responses, as people submit one per WG so it is hard to see how many unique consenters there were). - We noted it could be interesting in the retrospective to consider overall patterns of *how* consenters took part (e.g. were there fewer objections than last time? Were objections similar to last time, or different? Were there people who blanket unapproved all WGs, like there was last time?)  Documentation of Governance WG meetings - We agreed it's not an entry-level task. - We agreed the low-ish price ($20) might be putting people off doing it; people might also be put off by feeling that summaries need to be very detailed - We noted that there is still quite a bit of work to do on the backlog of summaries from Q3 and Q4 - there are people working on it, but $20 feels very low, as backlog work is harder since it's not fresh in the mind - We discussed whether people should be able to document meetings they were not present at, and concluded that while it's better if you were there, it's OK to work from the Read.ai transcript (though *not* from just the Read.ai summary, as those are often very inaccurate) - We agreed that to make documentation less onerous (especially for the backlog work) it is OK to focus on decisions, action items, and who was present - We agreed to raise the price (see 'decisions')  Next WG Sync Call date  - Next call is supposed to be Thurs 30th Jan at 10:00 UTC - is this too early in the day? Peter will ask in Town Hall tonight about preferred date and time - possibly move to Weds 29th at 13:00 UTC  WG unspent budget / budget reserves - We outlined the current process (unspent budget used to be clawed back by Treasury - but since Jan last year, it has not been. Anything that a WG doesn't spend, becomes part of their WG reserves and they can still use it.) - Should there be a time limit on how long a WG has to use budget that was allocated to a particular task? And if they want to change what they use it for, how should they do that? - How to avoid gaming the system (e.g. submitting a quarterly budget to do amazing things, to ensure consent; but then changing it to less impressive things in the first week of the Quarter) - We agreed on a suggested approach based on a 'change request' process if a WG wants to make major changes (see 'Decisions' below) and agreed to submit this as a potential new Treasury Policy.",

(If no objections, the WG can go ahead: if anyone objects, we didn't decide how that should be processed. Discuss in a Governance meeting?) - A 35% + change request needs to be included in the WG's budget proposal for the following Quarter (note that it would be separate from, and in addition to, their budget cap for that Quarter. So if a WG has a cap of 5k AGIX for Quarter 2 2025, and has 1k AGIX unspent from Q1 that it wants to reallocate, it will therefore have a total of 6k AGIX to work with). - If a WG has unused budget at the end of a Quarter that they still intend to use as originally planned, they don't need to do anything special - they just do the work as and when they can.",

See the Miro board here https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLtid06I=/  Everyone present agreed that the implementation of budget caps has been broadly a success, especially in that it saved time and made the process less onerous; and most said that caps should be used again for Q2. However, several people noted that some of the higher-budget workgroups were not entirely happy at the enforced lowering of their budgets; and that we still need to discuss and refine the process of setting caps and e.g deciding how a WG's cap can be changed.  We noted that this last topic is on the rolling Governance WG agenda for our next meeting on Thurs 16th Jan.",
