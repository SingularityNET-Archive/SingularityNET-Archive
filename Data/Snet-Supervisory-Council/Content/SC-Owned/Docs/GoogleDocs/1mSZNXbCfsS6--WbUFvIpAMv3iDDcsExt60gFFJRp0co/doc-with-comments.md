# Proposal

## Subsequent Supervisory Council



**Context**

The current supervisory council will end their mandate on May 31st, leading to a halt in the process. We hereby propose to launch the elections of a new council following this proposal’s approval. In addition to current responsibilities, the new council will have the following mandate and configuration.



**Objective**

Continue stewarding the process of decentralization by:

Receiving control of the Supervisory Council wallet and managing said funds to steward the process of decentralizing SingulairtyNET in coordination with the Foundation and Community.

The ones that are granted or some existing treasuries?
Should this proposal include an appending for Treasury Proposal (similar like Ambassador Program to incentivise Open Source contributions)

Selecting, writing, and launching RFPs, via DeepFunding, for 3 selected experiments and workgroups to evolve areas of the Blueprint ( draft here ).

Currently, the RFP-design pool can only have 3 winners. Unless that changes, it's a problem. Because of who the SC is, they are likely to get far more traction for their proposals than other proposers will; so at best, it gives an unfair advantage, and at worst, it will effectively rule out anyone else from getting funded in this Pool. Which is kinda the opposite of decentralisation.

A bit similar to the situation we saw in Project Catalyst when IOG started proposing in certain categories. They argued "Hey, we're just proposers now, just like any of you!", ignoring the special status they have. And ofc, as it turned out, nobody else really stood a chance in the Categories they proposed in.

Overseeing any edits to the Blueprint document (the document is thus under the governance of the future council and is made available open source for the community).

I'd like to see the Blueprint pass into some form of community ownership after the end of the SC's current term - ofc, fixing and archiving the version that the SC approved, and then going forward to future versions run by the community.

Altho possibly, what could be interesting is to have 2 parallel Blueprints - one where the SC continues to control edits, and another where the community does?
>   - Daniel Ospina: there's no clear entity defined as "the community" so it's impossible to define who would have access to the platform where the doc is hosted and how decisions would be made, hence why we're suggesting having the SC own it.
Note that the document is open source so anyone can fork it and create their own version.

Once the proposal teams have been selected for the RFPs via community voting, oversee the work of the teams (mentorship, approval of milestone payments, approval of change of plans to ensure agility, and review of impact assessments).



**Size of the Council**

Recommended 4 members with a 3/5 signing power on the multisig. With one Foundation member, the decentralization lead, appointed as the 5th signature in case of emergency (e.g. sufficient council members not available for longer than 1 week to sign due to illness, etc.). 

> [Comments]
> Context - Recommended 4 members
> * Vanessa Cardui: What's the rationale for 4 members rather than 3? An even number sets up the possibility of a split vote, 2/2, whereas an odd number will at least mean a 2:1 majority - tho ofc majority decisionmaking isn't always that great anyway, so is that the thinking behind moving to 4?

Additional budget for task force members for communications and marketing support.



**Term**

The 2 members with the highest votes are elected for 2 years, the following two are elected for 1 year. This system provides continuity with two new members elected every year.

We could assign years based on voting results.
Top 2 selection get 2 year term,
Where next 2 get the 1 year position.

However I also see its very important to see how council members perform.
So it might be better to vote in top 4 for 1 year and then each following year there is revote for existing members and select 2 out of them (always might not have a vote at all if someone decides to step down)
and then 2 from new candidates
>   - Rebecca Rachmany: This is only a one-time issue, so we didn't want to make it overly complex. Yours is a good idea but I wonder if is worth creating tooling for that given that it is just a one-time issue.

Members of the council can be re-elected 1 year after the end of their term. If a member withdraws, the candidate with the following number of votes is offered the position, and if they refuse, a new election is triggered.



**Expertise recommended**

The following expertise are recommended for candidates:

Web3/DAOs legal

Change management

Organization design

Governance

Design Thinking 

> [Comments]
> Context - Design Thinking
> * Vanessa Cardui: This is a very specific approach (and is very business-orientated, as opposed to community-engagement orientated). Are we sure we want to embed it particularly, over other relevant approaches? Why? 

(One relevant approach that springs to mind for me is co-production, (but of course, there are others) - and personally, I'd *love* to have it specified that candidates must have demonstrable experience of working with communities in a co-produced way. But others might not agree. So rather than insisting on any specific theory, I would suggest we should keep to the more general areas of expertise - maybe Web3 legal; governance; and crucially, add "community engagement".)

And I'd say candidates shouldn't necessarily have to have expertise in all of them.
>   - Daniel Ospina: Desing Thinking is a design methodology, it can equally be applied to business and non business topics. The reason why it has been suggested here is because it emphasises:
- learning and experimenting over preconceived assumptions
- iterative cycles
- empathy with users
- both divergence and convergence

It's maybe been bastardised a bit in some business circles but at the base it's just a very good practice for most mechanisms/tools/objects/etc that are to be used by humans.

The clear limitation is had is related to understanding system dynamics and complexity.

In that sense, a better framework that does take into account co-production type of things (3rd order design as opposed to DT which is just second order) would be Systemic Design THinking

(i.e. https://conductal.medium.com/beyond-design-thinking-the-systemic-design-thinking-framework-8d4952271222 )

I personally opted for recommending Desing Thinking because it provides a good foundation and the pool of talent that understands Systemic Design  Thinking is absolutely tiny, so would likely make the application process less successful annoyingly.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: OK - but the point I'm making is that I don't think **any** specific theory or methodology should be a requirement even to stand for election.
Let candidates say if they're wedded to a particular approach - or what their influences are - and let the community decide :-)

Additionally, at least 1 member should have been actively involved in the community for at least 6 months.

> Context - at least 1 member should have been actively involved in the community for at least 6 months
> * Vanessa Cardui: Don't think this is enough. I'd say at least 2 members should have this characteristic.

But, whether it's 1 or 2, I'm not clear how this would work. Say all 4 elected people have had no involvement with the community - do we reject the least-popular and then go down the list till we find someone who has? Or do we have 2 separate shortlists/application processes - one for people who have been part of the community, and another for those who have not?

Also what would be the threshold for "actively involved in the community for the last 6 months" - in other words, what level of involvement would count as "actively involved"? And **which** community?
>   - Guillermo Lucero Funes: If there's no clear entity defined as "the community" what Community members are we referring to? AGIX/ASI  holders? 

It would probably be a better idea to be more specific about the description and basic needs, since saying 'DAOs legal' doesn't mean anything.

I understand that it would be ideal to have more actively involve members of the Ambassador program, the core contributors task force, being not only the members of my 'community' most committed to the vision and mission of snet, but also the members with the most knowledge of the ecosystem. If you ask me, after the members of the foundation, I would not hesitate to fill the rest with snet Ambassadors.

**Compensation and commitment**

It’s recommended to offer a regular day rate of at least $1,000 and a minimum commitment of 2 days per week.

> Context - It’s recommended to offer a regular day rate of at least $1,000 and a minimum commitment of 2 days per week.
> * Tevo Saks: is it meant like average 8 hours a day for fixed days?

Or is more like 16 hours of distributed time per week
>   - Rebecca Rachmany: We don't think it is necessary to micro-manage at the level of telling people what days and hours to work. The hours are naturally distributed because of the regular meetings required of people.
>



**Election process**

Recommended using the same process as the previous election cycle. Process to be organized by the Foundation’s decentralization lead as per her responsibilities, with the support of the marketing department. Subsequent election processes can be evolved through an experiment and ratified via the Meta Governance process in the Blueprint.



**Handover**

The current council is barred from being elected for a new term. However, we remain at the disposal of the newly elected council to provide advisory, recommendations, or consultation upon request and mutually agreed compensation to ensure appropriate handover and the best outcomes for SingulairtyNET and its community.

> * Vanessa Cardui: Not sure I agree with this. In line with the points made above about continuity, I'd say it might be actually **desirable** for the current SC members to be allowed to stand.

Ofc if none of them *want* to, that's another thing! - but I'd say perhaps they should be theoretically allowed to. Perhaps with the proviso that no more than 1 of them can be elected.

Not 100% sure about this tho - would love to hear what others think
