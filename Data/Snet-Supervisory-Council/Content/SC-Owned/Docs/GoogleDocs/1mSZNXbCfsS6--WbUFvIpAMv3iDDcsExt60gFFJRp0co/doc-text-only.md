# Proposal

## Subsequent Supervisory Council



**Context**

The current supervisory council will end their mandate on May 31st, leading to a halt in the process. We hereby propose to launch the elections of a new council following this proposal’s approval. In addition to current responsibilities, the new council will have the following mandate and configuration.



**Objective**

Continue stewarding the process of decentralization by:

Receiving control of the Supervisory Council wallet and managing said funds to steward the process of decentralizing SingulairtyNET in coordination with the Foundation and Community.

Selecting, writing, and launching RFPs, via DeepFunding, for 3 selected experiments and workgroups to evolve areas of the Blueprint ( draft here ).

Overseeing any edits to the Blueprint document (the document is thus under the governance of the future council and is made available open source for the community).

Once the proposal teams have been selected for the RFPs via community voting, oversee the work of the teams (mentorship, approval of milestone payments, approval of change of plans to ensure agility, and review of impact assessments).



**Size of the Council**

Recommended 4 members with a 3/5 signing power on the multisig. With one Foundation member, the decentralization lead, appointed as the 5th signature in case of emergency (e.g. sufficient council members not available for longer than 1 week to sign due to illness, etc.).



Additional budget for task force members for communications and marketing support.



**Term**

The 2 members with the highest votes are elected for 2 years, the following two are elected for 1 year. This system provides continuity with two new members elected every year.



Members of the council can be re-elected 1 year after the end of their term. If a member withdraws, the candidate with the following number of votes is offered the position, and if they refuse, a new election is triggered.



**Expertise recommended**

The following expertise are recommended for candidates:

Web3/DAOs legal

Change management

Organization design

Governance

Design Thinking



Additionally, at least 1 member should have been actively involved in the community for at least 6 months.



**Compensation and commitment**

It’s recommended to offer a regular day rate of at least $1,000 and a minimum commitment of 2 days per week.



**Election process**

Recommended using the same process as the previous election cycle. Process to be organized by the Foundation’s decentralization lead as per her responsibilities, with the support of the marketing department. Subsequent election processes can be evolved through an experiment and ratified via the Meta Governance process in the Blueprint.



**Handover**

The current council is barred from being elected for a new term. However, we remain at the disposal of the newly elected council to provide advisory, recommendations, or consultation upon request and mutually agreed compensation to ensure appropriate handover and the best outcomes for SingulairtyNET and its community.
