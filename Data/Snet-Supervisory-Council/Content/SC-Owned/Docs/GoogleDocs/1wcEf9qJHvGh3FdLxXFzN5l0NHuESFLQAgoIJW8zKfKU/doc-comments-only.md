> * Lori Guidos: This could be a blockchain function to ensure a peaceful transmission of administrative roles. Upon election, switch out the "role" of the "retired" SC to "SC Admin Emeritus" and the "newly elected" SC to "SC Admin". Therefore, ensuring a peaceful transition of roles. The emeriti role would still have the power to assist in making changes, but only with the "sign-off" of the current SC Admin.

#### Context - The communications platforms are fragmented, with different groups using different platforms to do their major work. The groups tend to have their own control of the platforms that they are using. In the Ambassador Program there are multiple people who have Administrator access. In other programs, .
> * Lori Guidos: Don't forget the use of Communitq for the forums on the website which controls info@singularitynet.io.

>   - Lori Guidos: The platform is the singularitynet.io website.

The "forums" SNET uses are from Communiteq.com. On the homepage choose Menu, Forums.  This path has been changed, I don't know if it is by the scammers or SNET.  You can still find the forum by going to community.singularitynet.io.

The "forums" also control the "Contact" link ( Menu, Contact) which sends emails to the consumer from what appears to be  info@singulritynet.io. 

When I left my message in the contact form on the website, I was told in an email reply to go to either https://livechatsupport.app (not in service anymore) or https://dappwalletauth.web.app (active) and I could be be reimbursed for losing my FET wallet by a phishing scheme. You probably can test this yourself, by emailing the email and explaining that you have lost money due to phishing and see what they do.

I did contact Communiteq.Com's support tech Richard who told me the info@singularitynet.io is being controlled by a hotmail account.

I will avoid repeating my story about losing my FET to a "Sergey Shalyapin" via DM from the Telegram SingularityNet Community Group.  But will add that they no longer need someone to front via a DM because the group now just directly sends people to be scammed using: https://wappunifxings.pages.dev

I will add that the wallet that scammed me is: 0x9d8064cc92e06ccedb04f1b3a5093474ad463b0f in case you come across it some where.

I can't tell if the whole organization is colluding with the scammers or not.

Originally, I came to the website to learn how to get involved with SingularityNet, but I ended up learning how fast a fool can be separated from their money.  

I was hoping for a kind, loving, peaceful experience.  I learned that as long as there is evil in the world, decentralization will not work, until we invent blockchain that protects each transaction on a wallet like the credit card companies do by protect each transaction using an insurance scheme.

which is odd, actually, as the 2 words have **really** different implications - fundamentally different, actually. Feels like this is a "thing" that needs thinking about.
>   - Elizabeth Cusma: Then I will change it to Benevolent.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: I honestly dunno about this. "Benevolent" has implications that "beneficial" doesn't, and which I really don't think we want.

"Beneficial" is firmly human-centric. *We* (humans) decide what is, and is not, "beneficial" to us.

"Benevolent" implies an attititude of mind that AI supposedly has **towards* us. Which (given that AI is not capable of either independent thought, or "attitudes of mind"), is a false implication, and not something I'd want to see used, as it's kind of unethical.

I feel like maybe this phrase "benevolent AGI" gets used mainly because many people are not all that precise in their use of language?
>   - Elizabeth Cusma: If SNET's internal documents use 'benevolent' than we should in this document also. You make excellent points, but the term in not under conversation in this blueprint-that's an issue for SNET to decide separately.
>   - Vanessa Cardui: I've already pointed out that internal documents use *both*, and seem to use them interchangably. The sNET website itself uses "beneficial" as I stated above. So there's no particular justification for using "benevolent".
