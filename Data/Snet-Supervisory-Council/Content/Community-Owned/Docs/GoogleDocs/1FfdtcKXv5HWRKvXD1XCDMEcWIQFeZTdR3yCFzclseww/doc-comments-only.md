#### Context - it is possible to perceive of the Ambassador Program as one of the governance experiments that has been tried and is successful (or not) so far, rather than a long-term fundamental part of governance.
> * Tevo Saks: The Ambassador Program has started and is using emerging models of governance. Creating the rules of engagement and groups based on people who can take on the accountability
> 
#### Context - Increasing developer engagement and retention, e.g. through hackathons, to expand the platform. This can overlap with Community and Ambassador functions.
> * Tevo Saks: Ambassador Program has provided opportunity for Code Developers, but here I think its better to list onboarding opportunities to developers, which would belong under below Onboarding section.

In the Developer Relations sections I think we should mentions main platforms and open source tools used and advocated for within Snet ecosystem
> 
#### Context - Obviously, these are not areas where it is desirable to change often.
> * Tevo Saks: In decentralized Networks, it does change often as members get more experience and groups get bigger.
Perhaps the Ethos doesn't change, but the wording does.

I have found that doing the collective driver mapping yearly would give direction for mission, vision, purpose and values and leaves a trail of co-created results
> 
#### Context - developer network
> * Stephen Whitenstall: This emphasis seems to leave out "nurturing a benevolent AI culture". After all, who is the technology for ? Why should anyone use it ? What makes it of benefit to humans ? Where is the benevolence ?
Development is (or should be) only a part of this. Another way to think about this is whether use comes before or after technology ? If use is an afterthought - "Cui bono ?" (Resolved by Grace Rachmany)
> 
#### Context - Sorry, I couldn&#39;t help but share it.
> * Guillermo Lucero Funes: @everyone
> 
#### Context - organisation
> * Marta Lenartowicz: I suggest starting from some clear ontology. For example is SNET really envisaged as an organisation? Or an open-ended, ever expanding unprecedented network that we want to eventually encompass all humanity's interfacing with all AI/AGIs which are interested to join the network and be mediated by it? If *organisation*, we are speaking about foundation, spinoffs(ecosystem), community (basically a collective name for all associated roles such as contributors, token holders, etc). But if *network* (which is my suggestion) the blueprint comes in as a sort of a constitution that starts from what the white paper and bylaws established and specifies types of entities, kinds of relations, types of decisions, structures for figuring things out (definitely not only voting, not only by token holders, and not only about grant allocations.) It may also need to loop back to the bylaws and formulate updates needed, as means of anchoring the blueprint there... (Resolved by Marta Lenartowicz)
>   - Grace Rachmany: This is probably beyond the scope of the mandate of this blueprint and the Supervisory Council, but it may be relevant to include some suggestions of how the network self-determines itself.
>   - Tevo Saks: Mm I would agree with the notion of Network here, because it encompasses much larger vision. Later going into Circles and Worgroups you are naming types of organising methods which can have different taxonomy or use case in different sub groups of the network.
>   - Tevo Saks: I think this paragraph is better suited to describe how different the decision-making processes are and the list of questions demonstrate the complexity of options
> 
#### Context - alternatives
> * Vanessa Cardui: Really would love to see an awareness of voting *alternatives* and experimenting on different, non-voting decisionmaking (Resolved by Grace Rachmany)
> 
> * Judith Williams: I would add anything regarding tech infrastructure under 'operations' (Resolved by Grace Rachmany)
> 
#### Context - Compensation
> * Vanessa Cardui: Add something around What is "work", what do we define as work? How we recognise "less visible" work? (Resolved by Grace Rachmany)
> 
#### Context - Participatory documentation processes
> * Vanessa Cardui: Not an adjunct - good discoverable documentation is a key element of decentralised governance
> 
#### Context - Starting conditions
> * Esther Galfalvi: Maybe these  subsections should be integrated with the other sections - is it too much of a "throw in" paragraph? (Resolved by Grace Rachmany)
> 
#### Context - is
> * Judith Williams: not sure of the context of the sentence here, i am assuming the word is 'means?' (Resolved by Grace Rachmany)
>   - Daniel Ospina: why are you not using suggest mode?
> 
#### Context - How does the decentralized network plan to fund itself in the long term?
> * Peter Elfrink: Outside of Phase Two token mintings (which are very substantial) (Resolved by Peter Elfrink)
> 
#### Context - Incubation model
In some ways, the network functions like an incubator, but there are no structures in place for this to support the entrepreneurs.
> * Peter Elfrink: there's a circle of DF awarded teams which intends to give this support (Resolved by Peter Elfrink)
> 
#### Context - How should people be encouraged / invited to stay active in the community?
> * Judith Williams: this is where the Ambassador Program
should be mentioned (Resolved by Grace Rachmany)
> 
#### Context - How should people be encouraged / invited to stay active in the community?
> * Peter Elfrink: i think both deep funding and ambassador program are doing this already by having public sessions, chat groups etc. Of course its an ongoing process but the basics are there (Resolved by Grace Rachmany)
>   - Daniel Ospina: so we should remove it from the list or is it fine as is or?
>   - Peter Elfrink: Sorry was more a comment on the content than a list suggestion. I feel both DF and ambassador should be high level on the participation list
>   - Grace Rachmany: The blueprint describes both what has been done so far and a trajectory of where we would go. There is also a balance between decentralization and disorganization, and a need for more accountability in the programs.
> 
#### Context - Partnerships
> * Judith Williams: Partnerships could go under 'outreach'. outreach could be divided into internal and external outreach (Resolved by Grace Rachmany)
> 
#### Context - For e.g. calls for proposals could be created by councils rather than only by the foundation.
> * Peter Elfrink: 100%! and proposed by the community (Resolved by Peter Elfrink)
> 
#### Context - Funded projects “contracts”
> * Peter Elfrink: not sure if this refers to something else than deep funding, but there's contracts in place for that (Resolved by Peter Elfrink)
> 
#### Context - How should the rules for the Deep Funding programme be defined and created going forward?
> * Peter Elfrink: There's rules established, not sure if much changes would be needed (Resolved by Peter Elfrink)
>   - Daniel Ospina: are you suggesting the rules should never be changed?
>   - Peter Elfrink: not really, will resolve as it doesnt add much to the structure
