# Governance Decentralization Blueprint (outline)

# Index







# Overview

The SingularityNet community has expressed an explicit desire to create a more decentralized governance structure, moving from top-down governance of the Foundation to community-led governance. The transition will take place gradually, ensuring that none of the functions of the Foundation are neglected, and that power is passed off as the decentralized governance structures have proven themselves capable of taking on these powers.

To enable the transition, the Blueprint provides templates for developing decentralized governance experiments, prototypes, and deployments, and for determining the success of these prototypes. Rather than providing a framework for the governance itself, the Blueprint provides a framework and measures for taking steps towards decentralization.

# Purpose

In interviews with the SNET community, the following decentralization goals were stated:

Governance decentralization: moving decisions from the Foundation to the community.

Growth of the network: bringing in people who will be active in the network

Business sustainability: ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of the network through appropriate business models.

Context: SingularityNet is a network for the development of benevolent AI. Therefore, the efforts of the community need to be towards creating a developer network where this work can be performed, as well as a foundation for making sure the AI development is benevolent and beneficial. The following functions are required for the implementation of benevolent AI:

Development of technology (developers and entrepreneurs)

Product-market fit (entrepreneurs, financial models, marketing, customer service)

Ethical technology development (ethics experts, humans who use the technology).

Assessment of the “beneficial” and ethical nature of developments (creation of processes, procedures, and criteria for beneficial and harmful developments)

Sustainable tokenomics (financial expertise)

Risk assessment (as connected to ethical AI).

Understanding each individual’s place in the ecosystem has been one of the challenges faced to date. By honing in on these focus points for operation, each participant can better understand their role as it relates to the sustainability of the ecosystem.

# How to use this document



# Metagovernance

This is the highest level of governance: setting the rules for making the rules, seeing whether what we are doing is working, and providing opportunities to change the rules if necessary. Most people could expect to be involved in these decisions as they affect everyone.

## Assessing decentralization

Questions for the community:

What makes successful decentralisation?

What metrics do we think would represent this accurately?

Who should measure it and how often?

Who should assess whether there should be a change?

## Creating and changing rules and processes



Some rules and processes are local and some are global. Not everyone needs to be involved in local rules, such as how a team operates, who does what, etc.

Questions for the community:

How do we get together to create new rules? What kinds of rules can be created and by whom?

What are the conditions for active assessment of changing a process?

How can a crisis situation be addressed quickly? (i.e. if something needs to change urgently, such as some exploitation of the token or an urgent regulatory issue arises).

Who decides when a rule affects other parts of the system?

How should feedback be solicited and given on the overall system(s)?

What channels could people use to insist on addressing an issue?



# Starting conditions

These are the standing definitions, rules, and mechanisms that form the infrastructure of the DAO. Each of these can be locally determined, with some rules applying globally. It would be important for each nested group to make explicit its rules in the same way so that it is transparent how things are done and how they compare with other local and global rules.

The mission, vision and purpose may change over time. This blueprint  may suggest ways to do so, as well as an appropriate schedule for doing so. Obviously, these are not areas where it is desirable to change often.

### Mission

### Vision

### Purpose

To date, the purpose of the decentralized community has not been determined. It is within the scope of the Supervisory Committee to work with the community to determine a purpose.

### Values

Existing values as they are practiced / Aspirational values? Is this something that is determined by a process or observed based on behavior?



# Governance

## Legal framework

This is how the decentralized communities and SingularityNET avoid government, corporate, legal, or other kinds of capture. (Objective 3)



Legal expert needed to advise community on options to protect the decentralized communities.

Note: this may be determined to be out of scope during the discussions with the community



## Membership definitions

Questions for the community:

Who should be considered a “member”?

E.g. Is any tokenholder a member? Or do they need to contribute work? Even if they don’t contribute work, how do token holders (and people who are affected by AI) get involved in decision?

What is the threshold for contribution?

Should members be identifiable?

## Problem definition and purpose statement

## Strategy and goal-setting

How is strategy set and by whom? This fits into the governance structure above. All parts of the decentralized communities should be involved/represented - but who decides?

## Decision making processes

There are many kinds of decisions in an organisation. Not everyone needs to be involved in every decision, which is why there are circles and workgroups.

What kinds of decision making are there and what modes are there of doing them? (research needed by writers / expert group)

Who should be involved in large scale / directional decisions, and how?

What level of standardisation is desirable across teams?

Should we all use the same tooling for certain things, like task assignment or decision making/ ideation?

What feedback mechanisms should be used?

Fast crisis response mechanisms

Decision making processes (e.g. technical, like reputation / voting, and relationships with the decentralised groups - e.g. how are the groups represented?)



#### Decision ratification systems:

In some DAOs, some medium risk decisions - quantified by financial risk - are permitted to go ahead without a vote, provided two people are consulted, one of whom has related expertise to the decision domain. This could be a function performed in a general community layer, or an inter-team system that allows for an official “second opinion” sort of format.

## Voting and voting alternatives

Consensus / consent

Ranked voting

Using LLMs to determine sentiment / desires of hte community

Adaptive voting depending on types of decisions

Committee / expert decision-making

Retroactive funding / approvals

Reputation-based influence

Identification of strong outliers / risk assessment

Results-based decision-making





## Problem definition and purpose statement

Prior to creating proposals, problem definition or calls for proposal determine the scope of what can be proposed. The strategy and purpose should lead to calls for proposals. Having clear problem definitions and key measures and outcomes for success are important for knowing which proposals to accept. A decentralized process would include a larger number of people and entities in determining the scope of what can be proposed and what gets prioritized.

## Proposal creation

## Team creation

There could be a standard way of creating new teams. For example, starting a new group requires no permission. People can start doing what they want to generate value, and then make requests from Treasury and the rest of the community as they prove their worth. Alternatively, they can present a proposal to the community and to the Treasury. Or they can apply to DF, but bearing in mind that DF is specifically to do with growing the platform.



## Conflicts of interest

How to deal with conflicts of interest among different groups, issues of ethics vs. money, etc.

## Accountability and delivery

Establishment of processes for assessing project delivery, milestones, etc.



Questions to the community:



What different accountability systems  could there be for delivery, collaboration, and quality control?

How should teams be accountable to each other? What bodies should offer accountability?

To a large degree this would be team-specific, but it may be helpful to have regular check-ins about goals and budgets. This could overlap with Treasury in making budget requests for teams



Example: **Annual peer review process**



No centralized decisions would be made on funding use by work groups. At the same time there could be accountability to all the other teams represented in the decentralized system.



## Code of Conduct

The Ambassador program has created a code of conduct. We may want to add a link here and/or key points, and investigate what process has been used to reach this. The blueprint may suggest methods for assessing the effectiveness, for enforcing the code of conduct, and changing the code of content as needed.

## Dispute resolution mechanisms

## Documentation  / knowledge management\

Documentation and knowledge management has two main aspects that should be addressed:

The quality and accessibility of the documentation (including translations) determines whether the decentralized governance systems are accessible to people.

Access to the knowledge distribution systems is currently centralized. For example, a limited number of people can access and change the official YouTube channels, Github repositories, and other archive systems. In other words, someone with the keys to the documents can change history -- so how do we govern the access to the documentation and knowledge bases?



Unifying the different knowledge bases in the decentralised communities



This would help to create a way for the network to:

Provide knowledge value to itself

Provide knowledge value to outside decentralised organisations (c.f. The Ambassadors’ goal of providing infrastructure)

Avoid reduplication of effort

Accumulate the information for more sophisticated metrics over time



It could include AI tools to integrate and make the most of the data.

Ambassador programme has already been experimenting with this. Could be value in more experimentation.



Should documentation be standardized?

Which documents should be standardized?

Should AI tools be integrated, and how?

How to ensure high quality data inputs for knowledge management?

How should governance decisions be tracked and presented in a transparent way?

## Deliberation and signaling

Discussion is an important way of participating in a democratic process. The signals and opinions expressed in a good discussion can determine the organization’s direction and strategy. It is even possible that AI assessment of discussions could replace “voting” as a decision-making method by understanding the signaling.

When people participate in discussion, it’s important that they feel their opinions are considered and that what the community says actually does influence the decision-making. The right types of tools can strengthen the power of the community and help reach better decisions.



## Ethics and safety

How should the organization monitor ethics and safety internally?

Can a main purpose of the organization be to broaden discussions about ethics among more people, not just within Singularitynet?





# Participation process

Currently, the Foundation is fully responsible for finding, onboarding, and providing support to the developers who are funded within the SNET ecosystem. Elements of administration and functioning could be delegated to the community.

This is a prospective structure for the DAO.

## Communications channels

## Outline of participation processes

## Grant system (Deep Funding & other programs)

### Positioning

Currently the major means of participation is through applying for grants through the Deep Funding programme.

Community questions:

What should the relationship be between the community DAO and Deep Funding?

Should there be a generic grant programme for community initiatives, independent of DF? How could this be funded?

How should the rules for the Deep Funding programme be defined and created going forward?

Could we experiment with a small grant programme (at first potentially provided by the Foundation or allocated from the DF programme, but hopefully later sourced by the community itself) and pilot/experiment with other means of allocating funding?

### Grants RFPs and prioritization

For e.g. calls for proposals could be created by councils rather than only by the foundation.



## Operations

### Treasury

### Compensation

Current mechanisms provide compensation only for the winners of grant funding. Those who provided comments, dialogue, and sensemaking around the prioritization and proposals receive nothing.

What kinds of compensation should there be?

How do we define work?

How do we recognize less visible work?

Should there be affordances for holiday/sickness/vacation/social benefits?

How do we address differences is cost of living in different locations?

How should it be determined and by whom? For example, do we create tiers? Do team members create their own compensation proposal to be adjusted by the rest of the team? Or does the rest of the team propose the compensation for a new recruit?

Possible types of compensation

Financial - regular

Financial - per task

Non financial rewards

E.g Non value, non transferable token (e.g. ambassador new tokens? Badges / other social recognition

- Non-financial prizes and awards (e.g. tickets to SingularityNET-run events, subscriptions, mini-tooling requests funded by the DAO, free access to things like wellbeing programme sessions) [suitable for: casual contributors; recognition for outstanding work among regular contributors; winners of challenges]



### Marketing

Outreach and communication.

### Developer relations

Increasing developer engagement and retention, e.g. through hackathons, to expand the platform. This can overlap with Community and Ambassador functions.

### Onboarding

Developer and project onboarding, as well as Ambassador and governance group onboarding. Help with individuals looking for an area where they can contribute.

### Grants assistance

Help in creating proposals with good chances of getting funded.

### Business support, mentoring, and ideation

Mentoring around business needs, sustainable financial models.

### Developer support

### Partnerships and ongoing funding support



## Community

What do we mean by community? The “community” is more like a working group. These are different sub-groups, some paid, some not paid, some with different definitions of “decentralization” and “benevolent”.



## Ambassador Programme

The Ambassadors has been put in place as part of the community functionality. Defining the purpose of the ambassador program is key to understanding how it fits in and what key functionalities it should hold. It is also possible that a different structure than an Ambassador Program would fulfil these functions. This section may not be necessary in the final document-- it is possible to perceive of the Ambassador Program as one of the governance experiments that has been tried and is successful (or not) so far, rather than a long-term fundamental part of governance.



Community questions:

What should the relationship between Ambassadors and Community DAO be?

How could the two groups support each other? (e.g. devrel outreach and marketing - see Operations > Marketing and Operations > Developer relations)

Should the Ambassadors be subject to the same overarching accountability mechanisms (and reporting) as the rest of the DAO, or remain completely independent?

### Non-business mentoring/buddying

This is a category of internal support. The community DAO provides us with an opportunity to do this better than traditional organisations. It could involve:

Providing ongoing support to non-technical / operations or community teams after onboarding

Providing mutual support on an informal basis (could be an optional buddy programme)

Creating communities of support around groups

### Deployment and marketing support

### Community internal support

How should the community look after itself? Supportive organisations can provide:

Adequate work life balance

Suitable community support and mentoring

Learning opportunities

Physical and wellbeing support

Career support

Should community support be handled internally within teams, or should there be a common community infrastructure?

How should community support be funded?

#### Professional development



This is for individuals, not necessarily for teams.  E.g. workshops like Facilitation, or communally developed schedule of Learning Fridays, where community members can hold sessions (suggested in Discord. There is a consultation document: Learning Fridays consultation - Google Docs but yet to be properly collaborated on)



#### Buddying / general mentoring

Teams would normally have their own mentoring process, but this could be supported by the community support layer, for example gathering expertise from people who are not in the team but nevertheless are experienced in that field.



The SCDAO support framework could provide a linking system between experienced members and new arrivals, or people needing support in specific areas.

Community support could in time also facilitate the creation of a peer coaching system - where different groups could share knowledge to promote excellence.

#### Onboarding support



#### Conflict resolution

The community layer could provide a neutral party to act as the first point of conflict resolution. It can either be resolved according to a defined protocol, or be escalated



Community questions:

Who should be involved in conflict resolutions?

What are the different levels of escalation?

Who has the final say?

What are the compensation mechanisms for different levels of escalation? (e.g. formal mediation)







Other possible areas within community support could include:



**Wellbeing and health**

**Support for specific groups** (e.g. women’s circles or more or less geographically situated support groups, or newbies)

**Career support / career counselling**

**Intra-ecosystem outreach** - e.g. to spinoffs to improve comms and reduce siloing (in so far as it is outside the capacity or domain of the Ambassadors, or perhaps in collaboration)





### Community engagement

How should people be encouraged / invited to stay active in the community? How does our community engage other communities?

### Education programmes and workshops

(for orientation and onboarding - see below for other professional learning opportunities) e.g. through Ambassadors



# Technical infrastructure

What systems and tools do we need to make the organisation work properly?

## Reputation

## Voting implementation

## Decision tooling

## Payment and work tracking systems





Business / Network Sustainability

## Connectivity: What is a network

It is a bit unclear what it means to be part of the “Ecosystem”. The draft of the blueprint should specify what the “ecosystem” means and how it is envisioned. This work overlaps with the ecosystem strategy work, and we hope to draw on that to avoid duplication of effort.

## Spinoffs and obligations to the ecosystem

When SingularityNet uses its resources to spin off other companies, there is room for formal and informal lines of communications and participation in governance.

## Incubation model

In some ways, the network functions like an incubator, but there are no structures in place for this to support the entrepreneurs.



A fork of DF could be made when there is revenue, e.g through a Beneficial AI donation initiative (the foundation is exploring this already but it is in nascent stages - could be a community venture)



DF advice could be taken to inform the processes, e.g. to form peer review groups.



## Funded projects “contracts”

The relationship between the funded projects and the “network” is currently unclear and it would make sense to formalize these relationships or provide different types of “contracts” that would contribute to the long-term sustainability of the network.

## Financial sustainability

How does the decentralized network plan to fund itself in the long term?

For example, could we experiment with a small grant programme (at first potentially provided by the Foundation or allocated from the DF programme, but hopefully later sourced by the community itself) and pilot/experiment with other means of allocating funding?

Could we use a grant from DF specifically aimed at generating revenue to fund SCDAO functions and other projects?

## Experimentation framework
