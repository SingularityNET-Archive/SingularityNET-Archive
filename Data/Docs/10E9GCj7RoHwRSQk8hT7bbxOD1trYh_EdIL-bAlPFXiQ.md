Additionally, during the inception phase of the Gamers Guild, the Onboarding Workgroup played a vital role in promoting our meetings.

In the onboarding meeting, we shared our plans to integrate Roblox into our activities during March and demonstrated a prototype of our workgroup's project within Roblox, showcasing a 3D model that we had created. The members of the Onboarding Workgroup were highly impressed by our initiative and expressed enthusiasm for the integration of our project into the Roblox platform.



In addition to promoting our meetings, we also learned valuable insights from the Onboarding Workgroup, which will help us enhance our onboarding processes and improve the overall experience for new members joining our workgroup.



Overall, the collaboration with the Onboarding Workgroup proved to be fruitful, as it allowed us to share ideas, showcase our progress, and gain valuable feedback from fellow members of the SingularityNET community.
