## Onboarding WG Survey Ideas



The first survey idea though brief is for the onboarding sessions that we do every quarter.



### Questions we could ask are as follows:

### ✅Have you been to any of our onboarding sessions before? If yes, which one? (this should include the date, month, and year)

### 04.23.2024 and a few others

### ✅How was the session for you? (options could be “Was it welcoming?” “Was it informative?” etc.) oh I felt very welcomed

### and I learned quite a bit about how SNet  would like to work, (Decentralization) and how collaboration is different from Decentralization. I also learned that some damn smart people initially organized SNet. I was very impressed with the Onboarding.



✅ Did you find it helpful to your journey in the SNET Ambassador program? If yes, include a brief description. If not, please tell us why. I thought it was perfect for me, to have guidance but still be learning on my own. I think its the best solution for SNet integrating new people that want to get involved.



✅Is there something you feel was missing in the session? Not that I can think of…



✅Was it enough to make you feel ready to contribute to the growth of SingularityNET?

Oh yes, it gave me the jumping off point that I ne eded.



✅Is the timing for our onboarding sessions okay for you? (yes, or no with reasons). Yes, I agree with once a week sessions



✅How often do you think we should hold sessions? Once a week



✅What do you think we should do to improve our onboarding sessions for you and every new member out there? Nothing comes to mind right now



✅What would you like us to cover in an onboarding session? Maybe having the simplest breakdown of the structure of SNet itself, sometimes that feels a bit muddy to me.  I.e. when you have X question, where can you go and if you have XX question, where can you go.  Maybe I’m not clear, let me know.



Also: If I wasn’t to actually FILL OUT this survey, let me know, I got confused between my role as Community Member and WorkGroup Member!







The second survey idea is for our weekly meetings
