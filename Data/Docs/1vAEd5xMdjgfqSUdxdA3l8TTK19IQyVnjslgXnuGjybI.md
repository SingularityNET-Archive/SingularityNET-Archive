# 3) Three “onboarding journey” characters

Based on the above, we will create 3 imaginary characters to devise onboarding journeys for. Each one will have several characteristics - some that will help their journey, some that might hinder it, and some that are neutral.

### Character 1

Knows (or doesn’t know?) a lot about AI

### Character 2

First language isn’t English, so faces a language barrier

### Character 3

Is confused about the difference between deep funding and the ambassador program

# 4) The journeys

We will draft what we think each character’s journey might look like over a period of, say, 6 months.



These journeys will include several steps, not just one. They will include positive things that the character might experience; and barriers they might face.



For the barriers, we can suggest ways that the character might overcome them, if we are aware of any - but we need to beware of “preaching” about how someone should overcome a barrier, especially a barrier that we ourselves have never experienced. Alternatively (and perhaps more realistically) we could just leave the barrier in place, as something that the character has to deal with longterm. These journeys could be used to raise awareness in the community - “ what could we, as longterm contributors, do to help dismantle or address this barrier? ”

# 5) Presentation

How do we want to present this material?
