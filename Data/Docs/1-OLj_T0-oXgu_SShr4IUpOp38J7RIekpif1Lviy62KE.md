# Tag taxonomy project: training notes



Thanks for being part of this initiative!

The aim is to get our Archives corpus ready to use AI tooling more effectively - for searches, dashboard insights, and more.

## So what is a ‘tag’ anyway?

A tag is a type of metadata (data about data). It’s a piece of information that describes and classifies  the content that it’s assigned to - like a keyword that you might use in a search.



As you probably know, we ask people to add tags in the meeting summaries they submit via our Meeting Summary Tool . Some of them are literally called “tags”, but other things, such as

the names of people present

the names of those who facilitated and documented

the date of the meeting

action items and decisions

the titles of docs that are related to the meeting content

also function as tags. They will all help an AI search tool to find the information we ask it for.



Note that tags on websites are usually non-hierarchical - in other words, there are no “headings” or  “sub-categories”, and everything is on one level. This is very different from traditional archival cataloguing, which is hierarchical - it’s structured a bit like a tree. This tends to make it more organised, and makes search results more contextual and therefore more effective.



We have tried to approximate to an “archives-style” hierarchical catalogue in the Meeting Summary Tool by having different kinds of tags, in different categories. The type of tag that is being used functions as a “top-level”, and the actual tags themselves are a second level.

## A note on Emotion tags

We could call these “qualitative”, not  “emotional” - and some people wonder why we include them.

Yes, they’re subjective - and there’s nothing wrong with that. How a meeting felt is part of what happened at that meeting. If we can capture it, it brings our history to life, and gives information that readers won’t really get in other ways.



Note that opinions about how a meeting felt might vary from attendee to attendee - and nobody is “right”, or rather, everyone is!. So the cluster of tags in this section can be contradictory, to reflect the range of opinions from those present. One person might tag it “collaborative”; another might call it “autocratic” - it’s a matter of opinion, and in our decentralised community we’d like to capture the range of opinions.

That’s why in this project, your work will only be additive, not destructive - you won’t be deleting tags that someone else has given, but only adding additional tags that you think might be useful.



## What’s a tag taxonomy?

A “tag taxonomy” just means “the structures that things are classified into by using tags”. For example in the Archives, one way that things are classified is by date; another way is by the name of the meeting; and so on. This is all part of the taxonomy of the Archives.



We want our taxonomy to be created “from the ground up” by the whole community, not imposed 

from above. This is sometimes called “folksonomy” or “collaborative tagging”.



To do this, we currently collect ANY tags that people want to add via meeting summaries; and in this project, we’ll be adding more. Then at the end of this project, we’ll analyse them, look for similarities, and group them, and see if we can eventually lead to a controlled vocabulary. Perhaps we can’t! But if we can, it’ll make it easier for people to add tags in future, but the options we’ll be giving them will have come from the community, rather than us imposing them on people.



## What you’ll be doing in this project

We’re already succeeding quite well with getting tags from people via the Meeting Summaries - but there are still some gaps, and things that we could add.. This is what this project is about.



We’ll be asking each of you to go through a small part of the corpus, and add any tags you think are missing; then we’ll analyse and group them, and try to derive a controlled vocab.

You’ll be working in a spreadsheet. There’s a separate sheet for each team member, and I’ve assigned you a specific month of the existing corpus to work on.



## Using the spreadsheet

You’ll see which month you’ve been assigned to cover, and a link to that month in the GitBook.

Below that, on the left, you’ll see a row for each meeting summary in your section, and a link to it. Take each summary in turn, one at a time. Click the link to read the summary.

### On the left,

This first section, about tags, should be your main focus.

You’re looking for

topics covered in the meeting,

how you think the meeting seems to have felt.



For “topics covered”: what would someone search for?

What have you heard the topic being called? (so maybe “BGI” “BGI 2024” and “Panama” should all be added)

Any synonyms? Within reason, you can add some: e.g. “education”, “learning”

Use singular, not plural: if it’s tagged “workgroups” and someone searches for “workgroup”, it might not find it

Use single words first, then phrases only if you feel it’s important (“decentralization”, “blueprint”, “decentralization blueprint”; or  “education” “education guild”)

Include alternate spellings only if you can (decentralization, decentralisation) - don’t worry

Separate each entry in your list with a comma

Check your work very thoroughly for typos!



For “emotions”:  start with what the documenter has already put, if anything (summaries pre-2024 won’t have any emotion tags)

Try to understand what the documenter meant (if they say “friendly”, what do they mean?)

Be aware of this community’s tendency to avoid saying anything negative! There might be negative or neutral emotions that simply haven’t been tagged

Be aware that some documenters use the exact same 4 emotion tags for every meeting they document. Do these tags definitely relate to this meeting?

Prefer single words over phrases: but a phrase here and there is OK

You can use a thesaurus to help you find the right word for it: but don’t get too florid! Rare words are unlikely to be used in a search.

Again, check your work very thoroughly for typos!



### In the middle section, on documents:

Look at each summary and see if any documents, spreadsheets, videos, slides etc are mentioned or inferred, but the links are not given.

If you can actually find the link, fantastic - add it to the spreadsheet. 

But if not, just add to the sheet what the missing link is about, and what format it is - for example “Doc about roles and levels” or “Slides about onboarding process” - and we’ll try to find them later. 

Sometimes, you might not be certain that a relevant doc exists - but if you think there might be one, add a note on it just in case. We can check with workgroups later.

And note - if you can’t easily find the relevant doc, don’t spend a lot of time hunting for it. Just note that there probably is a doc somewhere about XYZ, and move on.



### On the right: only do this section if you have time.

This section is about decisions and action items. You’re looking for anything that is a “decision” or “action item” but is not marked as such in the summary.



First, let’s clarify the difference between a “decision” and an “action item:

A “decision” is simply something the WG agreed on in the meeting. There might be a rationale for it; opposing views might have been recorded too. 

An “action” is something that was assigned to someone to do. It will have one (or sometimes more) assignees, and a due date. Sometimes, though, you might have to infer these from what the summary says. For example, the documenter might have left “assigned to” blank, but it might be clear from the summary who is meant to be doing it. However, if you’re not sure, don’t guess.



For decisions, copy into the spreadsheet the text that you think should be tagged as a “decision”. If you can see information in the documentation to say what the rationale was, or any opposing arguments, add these too: but only if it’s there in the documentation, or if you were actually at the meeting and you are certain you remember Don’t guess! And definitely don’t add your OWN opinion. You’re a documenter, not a participant!



For action items, again, copy the text that you think should be tagged as an “action item”. If you can also see who it was assigned to and infer what the due date was, add that to the spreadsheet too.





And you’re done!
