# Onboarding WG - how can we support other WGs to onboard new people in their meetings?



### Add your ideas below in time for next week’s Onboarding meeting (5th Oct)



we could ask each WG to assign a bit of meeting time to discuss onboarding and how they do it - one of us would go along and explain our learnings from the Onboarding retrospective (i.e. that the message of decentralisation needs to be backed up in the program as a whole); then we find out what they each do to onboard new people who show up, what the issues are from their perspective,, and then we create a text resource with everyone’s ideas. (We’d also add our own ideas for what works)

we could set up a bounty for new people to share with us their experience of being onboarded and their suggestions for what works, and include this in the resource //could be part of the onboarding in general, ask how it went, personally not sure about bounties for this

Could encourage WGs to prioritise creating more entry-level tasks for newcomers - either via Dework, or directly in their meetings?

(V) We could suggest that Ambassadors TH always starts by reinforcing the message about “this is a decentralised community; you can take the initiative and contribute to changing things” - somewhat being done already, calling out self-organising workgroups Yeh true - but I think it’d be better if it was more explicit (V)(LadyTempestt - not sure how to get started with other WGs - maybe this is a message that could be reinforced in TH??)

Ask each Discord channel to put up a pinned post on how to get started in that channel. (Sucre n Spice)

Have a requirement for workgroups to explain their processes, as each workgroup is independent and may have differing requirements and procedures (Tevo)



Language we use can help with onboarding and understanding issues. (e.g. I often see people saying we have a “reputation system” - but  actually what we have is more a “contribution system”, and the difference is important. Reputation systems involve someone - often a centralised authority -  judging the value of what you contribute - they’re unpleasantly close to “social credit” systems, and often mean that minorities lose out since they might have a different set of values, so their actions will often be judged as “less valuable” by the majority culture. Whereas “contribution” is more about your **own** assessment of the value of what you do - it’s an embedding of the philosophical concept of the Principle of Charity , - in the sense that we assume that if you didn’t see your actions as valuable, you wouldn’t do them. In sNET we are more “contribution” - e.g. we log people’s Discord engagements, but there is no centralised authority that judges if those engagements are “good” or “bad” - so using the term “contribution system” consistently might help people understand the difference.)



What about a survey to everyone, to ask what made them feel “onboarded” and supported? Could be useful, in case we are making assumptions about what works to onboard people...  The survey ould give a few options to start people off (“feeling welcomed” “Understanding what is going on in the group” “Feeling useful and like my contribution is valued”; “Having responsibility”: “Being able to apply for Dework tasks” all spring to mind) then include “Other”: Yes could do and share via TH?

Vani and Lord Kizzy to make 1st draft and bring to next meeting
