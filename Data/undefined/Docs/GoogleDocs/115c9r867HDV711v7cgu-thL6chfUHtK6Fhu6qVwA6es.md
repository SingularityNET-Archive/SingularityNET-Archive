# Context-setting for Core Contributor decision on Q2 budgets



### What are the proposals we are deciding on?

This decision is about WorkGroup (WG) budgets for Quarter 2 (April, May, June) 2024.



In contrast to the way Q1 budgets were decided, this time Core Contributors are being asked to decide on each WG’s budget individually. You can see all the Q2 budgets (and the consent form for each one) here:



### Who will make this decision?

Core Contributors will make the decision.

The **Core Contributor** role is given to those who have contributed at least 12 hrs to the Ambassador Program in the last 6 months There are currently 51 Core Contributors (see detail, and list of who currently has the role, here ).



If you are a Core Contributor, you don’t **have** to take part - but it would be great if you did.



### How will the decision be made?

The decision will be made using **consent decision-making** . (This is the method being used for decisions in this Quarter. In future, different methods might be used.)



The process works by asking for any objections to a WG’s budget proposal, and then asking the objector(s) what would need to change in order for them to consent. If there are objections, there will be a meeting to discuss them.



You’ll find a Google form for each WG in **column J** here . You CAN complete a form for all of the WGs - even groups you belong to and/or and were involved in writing the budget for.



**Note** : Consenting does not mean you think the budget is perfect - it just means you think it would be safe to try it. In other words, **acceptance rather than agreement** . But if you think there are serious reasons not to accept it, you can object.



### What is the context for this decision?

The total budget for the Ambassador Program each Quarter is 172,944 AGIX (see https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/home/rewards-and-treasury/how-rewards-are-distributed )



S ince Q4 2023, each workgroup has submitted quarterly budget proposals. You can see past budgets in the 2nd and 3rd sheets of This time, budgets are in USD, to eliminate confusion about the exchange rate a group is using.



Before 2024, the decision-makers were those with the “Ambassador” role (a role held by around 9 people, and assigned by invitation from the existing Ambassadors). But currently, we are not assigning any new people as “Ambassadors”, and decision-making power is with the 51 “Core Contributors” (see above).



Workgroups are decentralised, so they might have different ways of writing their proposals, that fit the nature of the work they do.



But they should all itemise what money they need, and give some level of explanation for what each budget line covers.

### What is a valid reason for objecting to a WG’s proposed budget? .

A Core Contributor can object to a WG’s budget for any reason they see fit. But they must:



say what their specific objection is

say what would need to change in order for them to give their consent.



This is to ensure that the reasons for an objection are clear. This way, even if the objector prefers to maintain their anonymity, the objection can still be discussed.

### Background information on the process

This decision-making process has been discussed and agreed in several places in the Program, including Governance WG and Treasury Guild. You can find records of their meetings in the Archives , and further discussion in their Discord channels.



You can read about consent decision-making in general here , here and here .
